            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt every thing, Gentle Reader, which a man writeth privately &amp; ſodaynly to his frend is fit to be published openly to the view of the world: neyther did I think that this lettre written to Mr. Bernard in private vppon three dayes meditation ſhould have been made publique in print to every mans eye &amp; cenſure: which had I thought ſhould have come to paſſe, I would with better advyſe &amp; le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſeing it is juſtly occaſioned through Mr. Bernards importunity in his late published book intituled the Seperatiſts Schiſme, &amp; his ſlaunderous miſconſtructions &amp; miſreports vp &amp; downe the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind my back, that this lettre of myne is ſtrongly ſuſpected of error, bitternes, raſhnes, vncharitablenes, &amp; imputations of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like nature: &amp; by reaſon thereof my ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>By this place Mr. Bern. intended to ſinne againſt his conſcience for he did acknowledg this truth wee now profeſſe divers tymes, &amp; was vppon the point of Seperation with ſome of his people with him: yet loving the world &amp; preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as Naaman is thought to doe he choſe rather to ſtay ſtil in his vicaridge againſt his conſcience, then to leeſe it &amp; to follow Chriſt with a good conſcience: do you not remember Mr. Bern. what you ſaid to mee &amp; Mr. Rob. Southw. comming together from w: that ſpeaking of the daunger of walking in this truth of Chriſt we now profeſſe you ſaid you could eaſely die vppon the tre for the truth, but you could not withour great horror think of being burned as the Martyrs were in Q. Maryes dayes? &amp; that all the jorney you were caſting how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch your eſtate &amp; to get away with ſafety: I ſpeake this to prove vnto you &amp; the world, that you were as forward to the truth of Chriſt with vs then, as you were before to the cauſe of the Reformiſts: &amp; yet as then ſo now you have wholly &amp; I feare finally apoſtated from it: the L. be merciful vnto you in theſe your ſinnes: wherevppon this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that if ever you come to the truth of Chriſt wee profeſſe, you can not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the office of Elder in the Church, but therein you muſt beare your iniquity, bicauſe you have apoſtated fearfully from the truths you did acknouwledg, therein gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Suſpition of your conſtancy &amp; faythfulnes for the tyme to come: &amp; whither you be a worthy Miniſter of your owne Church, lett the Reformiſts judg who have be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trayed their cauſe into the Prelates handes ſo ſhamefully as you have done: wherfor be it knowne vnto you, firſt, that wee reject you, Seconbly, that the Reformiſts have juſt cauſe to reject you whither then wil you goe, but to your LI. the Prelates to whome you have ſworne your Can. obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; vnto whome you have now at the laſt fuly returned as it were a dog to the vomit, &amp; a ſwine to wallow in the myre.</p>
                  <p>But your covenant Mr. Bern. is beyond all the endevors of al the reformiſts of the land that you should cull out an hundreth perſons of ſo many paris hes ſo far diſtant to enter covenant together not to heare the dumb Miniſters, to watch one over another, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish one another, &amp;c. And therevppon to receave the Lords Supper: What? was not the covenant the Church of England large enough, but you muſt enlarge it thus? Did not your conſcience tel you then that the dumb miniſtery was vnlawful? that you ſinned in not admonishing your brethren &amp; therfor went to ſeek out an hundreth bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren where your proctor or agent could find them? That al your parish were not your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being not of your covenant, though of the covenant of the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? or that you had two ſorts of brethren, one of a general nature, viz: all the people of the parish? another of a Spiritual nature, viz: Thoſe hundreth perſons of your covenant? &amp; yet that you admitted both thoſe ſorts of your brethren to all the holy things among you, excepting the particular covenant? I pray you with your logick, or divinity, juſtifie vnto vs theſe things. But now all this is forgotten &amp; the Prelate of york hath ſo bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched you with his flatterie, eloquence, &amp; aungels, that your covenant is profaned &amp; caſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3153:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the duſt, men of your covenant muſt shift for themſelves, you have deceaved them like the ſtaffe of reed, &amp; you juſtifie your wonted ſpeeches, you love the world, &amp; eaſe with all your hart: &amp; therfor I ſay vnto you with the Apoſtle: The love of the Father is not in you: I do therfor Proclame you vnto the whole land to be one of the moſt fearful Apoſtates of the whole nation that excepting, VVhyte, &amp; Clapha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you have no Superior nor equal that I know or remember, who have thus often confeſſed &amp; witneſſed much truth, &amp; now not only have falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from it, but have ſo childishly &amp; yet moſt ſlaunderouſly written againſt the cauſe of the Lord, to blaſpheme the name of the Lord, his Tabernacle &amp; them that dwell in Heaven, as if, bicauſe your ſinnes were<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not known Sufficiently to the world, your would with inck &amp; paper publish them to al men &amp; ages to come, that they might remain in record agaiſt you vppon the file at the day when the Lord shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe every man according to his worke.</p>
                  <p>But Mr Bernard ther is yet one other thing that I muſt diſcover to the world: namely that you have written a book againſt the Prelates, wherein you have proved by divers arguments that their authority is Antichriſtian: this book ſome of your Frends have ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; read &amp; though you durſt not print it your ſelf, yet you would have been content a Frend should have cauſed it to be published vnder the vizard of an vnknowne Author: is not this ſo Mr. Bern? then tel mee with what face, or conſcience you can Subſcribe to the Prelacy, you can plead for the Prelacy: is not this to build that which you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? Surely all theſe things compared together do plainly convince, your deep Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy: &amp; yet in your pulpit &amp; among the ſimple ſort you would ſeem a brother to the Sonnes of Thunder: but I deſire the Lord to open the eyes of his people that they be no longer deceaved by ſuch Phariſaical Hypocrits as your deedes manifeſt you to be even in the indifferent cenſure of thoſe that love you beſt.</p>
                  <p>Now therfor to conclude this Parallele of your Famous or rather infamous acts: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your reſolurion againſt Subſcription &amp; conformity, with your Subſcription to the Prelate of york: your acknowledgment of the truth with Naamans preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſinne: your covenant, with your confirmity: your book againſt the Prelates, &amp; your book againſt the Seperation &amp; therevppon it will follow, that you are as chandgable as the Moone, as mutable as Proteus, as variable as the Chamaeleon. And whereas you object aganſt me pag. 37. &amp; 73. that before I came to the truth I wrote againſt it &amp; was diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to &amp; fro before I ſaw it cleered to my judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; conſcience, I muſt needes acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledg it ſo to be, which was my greater ſinne, &amp; the weaknes of my vnderſtanding, but therein the L. hath shewed mercy vnto me, which mercy I deſire alſo for you: but what is this to excuſe your ſlaundering, rayling, ſcoffing, inconſtancy, Apoſtacy, conformity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcription, blaſphemy, &amp; the reſt which you have plentifully diſcovered to al the world: Shew me, how &amp; when after the acknowledgment of the truth, I fell back as you have done many tymes? that I ever yeelded to the Prelates, conformity, or Subſcription, after I once withſtood it? &amp; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the reſt of your follyes ther is one vntruth that I did kneele downe &amp; praiſe God for Satisfaction after doubting, Not ſo: I remayned doubting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes till I ſaw the truth after I once doubted, but during the tyme of my doubting which was 9. Months at the leaſt I did many actions arguing doubting, but that I ever ſel back from any truth I ſaw I praiſe God, I can with a good conſcience deny it, &amp; you are never able to prove that againſt me: but the L. wil cut out the tong that ſpeaketh lyes.</p>

For if theſe opinious as wee hold them be the truth of God, then is he a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in a very high degree &amp; I would know whither he that heretofore oft tymes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed them for truths can nowwithout horrible impiety apoſtacy &amp; blaſphemy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme them Browniſtical opinions: ſee alſo whither his conſcience can be cleer in this</p>
                  <p>Now Further I deſire the reader to compare theſe 22. particulars, with the 16. points which I in this lettre have anſwered, &amp; therby he shal obſerve two things.

Secondly, that this book of Mr. Ber. is moſt properly &amp; directly aymed at my lettre, wherin I am moſt eſpecialy intereſſed to yeeld anſwer, &amp; though it be once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by another: &amp; happily may receave a third anſwer, yet <hi>I</hi> cannot overpaſſe it leaſt I ſeme to betray the truth who am by name ſingled out to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat? finaly ſeing Mr. Bern. hath published againſt vs without anſwer to this lettre, let vs alſo herin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider his fraud &amp; decept, in perverting, miſconſtruing, adding, detracting, falſely chardging vs follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing therein the dealing off his Father the Devill, with Chriſt, &amp; our firſt parents:

               <head>The third Section.</head>
               <p>The firſt point therfor that I wil ſpeak to is vour tenth. viz:</p>
               <p n="10">10. That an erroneous conſtitution of a Church is a real Idol.</p>
               <p>Heer I would fayne knowe whence you had this poſition, I confeſſe I have written ſome ſuch thing: but neither have I written neyther doe I hold it as you propound: I ſay that a Religions ſociety framed after the invention of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without the warrant of the word is a real Idol: but I do not ſay that ſome errors in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution of a Church maketh that Church a reall Idol: For as in generation every fault in the ſeed which is the matter, as for example a ſeed inclined to the gont, or conſumption, or ſtone doth not make a falſe man, but the partie begotten may be a true man not withſtanding the infirmity of the ſeed: So in the conſtitution of a Church not every error, (as if the members wherof the Church is framed have ignorances errors or infirmities in them,) maketh the Church a real idol: For ſo ther should never posſibly be a true Church in the world, ſeing it is imposſible to find men free from error. Therfor this is the ground that I hold, that if either the matter of the Church be not ſuch as the word teacheth, but a deviſed matter: or of the forme be not that which the word teacheth, but a deviſed forme: or if the Church have not the properties which Gods word teacheth, which doe neceſſaryly proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme induced vppon the matter: then ſuch a Church I avouch to be a real idol: take a fimilitude to illuſtrate it: The ſeed of an aſſe &amp; a horſe mingled together in generation doe not produce eyther a true horſe, or a true aſſe, but a third thing formally differing from both viz: a mule: even ſo wicked men joyned with Godly men in a Church, doe not produce a true Church, but a falſe Church, viz: a reall Idol the church of Antichriſt. For this point conſider what the holy Ghoſt writeth: Apoe 18.2. That Antichriſts Church is ther Propheſyed to be a cage of every vncleane &amp; hate<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful byrd, which might not be eaten or offered in Sacrifice by the Holy people, Deut. 14, 3.11. againe, 2. Cor. 6.14. The Apoſtle willeth the Corinths not to yoke with vnbeleevers bicauſe as in the old Teſtament the Holy people were forbidden to yoke an oxe which was a cleane creature, &amp; an affe which was vncleane to draw the plough together, Deut 22.10. Even ſo the faithful may not now yoke themſelves to draw the L. plough with vn belevers, bicauſe they may have no communion, concord, agreement, followiship, or part the one with theother, but the faithful who are righteouſnes, light of the body of Chriſt the Temple of God, the Children of God, muſt come out from the vnbeleevers, who are vnrighteouſnes, darknes, of Belial, the habitation of Devils, Apoc, 18.2, yea &amp; muſt be ſeperated from them: &amp; muſt touch none of there vncleannes. For if they ſtil ſtand in confuſion with the vnbeleevers, conſenting to al ther ſines, they in that conſtitution are not a true Church, but the prayers they offer vp with the prayers of the wicked, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from that falſe conſtitution are taynted with the idolatry of that conſtitution: but perhaps you wil ſay that although a falſe conſtitution be a ſinne yet it is not Idolatry: you muſt manifeſt it to me to be a ſin of another commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t if you plead that: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3153:8"/>I ſtil hold it to be a ſinne of the Second commaundement viz: to worship God in a conſtitution of an humane invention, even as it was in the Church of Ieroboams in vention: &amp; as it is in a popish parish aſſembly, &amp; as it is in the English aſſemblies: now further to prove vnto you that a falſe conſtitution of a Church is an Idol: I uſe theſe places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Cor. 6.16. VVhat agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</p>
               <p>The faithful who have made a covenant with God are heer cailed the temple of God: &amp; thervnto are Idols oppoſed: ſignifying that an aſſembly of men who are vnfaithfull, (though ſome faithful me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be among them who are commaunded to come out &amp; to be Seperated) endevoring to worship God after ther fashion are an Idol: therfor if the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ieruſalem now ſtood, &amp; the Iewes aſſembled to worship God ther after the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Old Teſtament, that aſſemblie was an Idol: So are the aſſemblies of Turkes Idols: So are the aſſemblies of Papiſts Idols: as Abbayes, Monaſteries, &amp;c. Such are al churches framed of a falſe matter, or having a falſe covenant.</p>
               <p>1. Ioh. 5.21. Babes keep your ſelves from jmages. Zach. 11.17.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle who wrote the Revelation forſeing through the Spirit of prophecy the abhominable Idolatryes of Antichriſt, which would grow vp in the Church giveth the Churches a caution eſpecially to take heed of thoſe Antichriſtian Idolatryes: now the Idolatryes of Antichriſt are not heathenish &amp; paganish, but of another nature, viz: not falſe Gods, but meanes invented by men to worship the true God in or by: Hence I ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther thus:</p>
               <p>VVhatſoever meanes is deviſed out of a mans brayne &amp; vſed as a meanes to honour God in or by, is an Idol:</p>
               <p>A deviſed conſtitution of a Church is of that nature.</p>
               <p>Ergo an Idol.</p>
               <p>For further amplification whereof conſider that as a falſe miniſter (wherof afterward) is an Idol miniſter: Zach. 11.17. So a Church of a falſe conſtitution is a falſe Church that is an Idol Chuch: &amp; as it was vnlawful yea flat Idolatry for a Prieſt of Ieroboams devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to offer Sacrifice to the L. So is it alſo Idolatry to offer vp ſervice to God in a Church of a falſe conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Col. 2.23. Mat. 15.9. Wil-worship &amp; vayne-worship is forbidden in theſe two places: namely, ſuch worship as is offered to God after the wil &amp; precept of man, whoſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is enmity to God:</p>
               <p>But a falſe conſtitution of a Church is after the will &amp; precept of man even invented &amp; deviſed: go it is forbidden: but wil worship &amp; vayne worship is a transgreſſion of the ſecond commaundement, go: it is idolatry, &amp; ſo that falſe Church wherin or wherby it is offered vp to God an Idol.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are manifeſt to him that wil not blindfold himſelf, I pray you conſider of the particulars by mee alledged: &amp; if you find a truth in them embrace the truth &amp; lead on your people with you to the truth: if not, let vs heer from you an anſwer, that we may ſee our errors, &amp; wee wil &amp; can reforme: ſo cannot you ſo long as you ſtand as you doe: ther is no way to reforme but to Seperate, as we have done already.</p>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:3153:9"/>
                  <p> I published a litle Methode not long ſince intituled, Principles &amp; inferences concerning the viſible Church: in the tenth page of the book I write thus: viſible Churches conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the deviſe of men are Real Idols.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bern. in the beginning of his third Section chargeth vs to hold,</p>
                  <p>That an erroneous conſtitution of a Church is a real Idol. &amp; in his book intituled the Seperatiſts Schiſme pag. 79, hath theſe wordes: They hould our conſtitution a real Idol, &amp; ſo vs idolaters: &amp; pag. 152. of the ſame book he writeth thus: that our Church (viz: the Church of England) ſtandeth in an adultrous eſtate: accounting this as an error that wee defend.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ainſw. in the anſwer to Mr. Bern. pag. 172. faith, that a falſe conſtitution of a church ſet vp in ſtead of a true, what is it better then a very Idol?</p>
                  <p>Heer let vs conſider the difference &amp; agrement betwixt Mr. Ainſ. &amp; me: he ſaith a very Idol, I ſay a real Idol: I cal a falſe conſtitution a real Idol, For that in exiſtence &amp; being it is an Idol: Mr. Ainſw. calleth a falſely conſtituted Church a very Idol, bicauſe it is indeed &amp; truly an Idol: heer is litle difference except it be in wordes: but for the further clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of my poſition viz: that a falſely conſtituted Church is a real Idol: two things muſt be diſcovered: 1. what an Idol is: 2. what Real is.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt vnderſtand that moſt properly an Idol is contrary to an ordinance apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God in matter of Religion: So the Apoſtle willeth the brethren to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from jmages or Idols, 1. Ioh. 5.21. &amp; the Lord himſelf in the Second Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forbiddeth, vnder the phraſes of making &amp; worshipping jmages, al inventions of men in matter of Religion, Exod. 20.4.5, Now matter of religion eſpecially ſubſiſteth, in Religious worship, or religious government, For the Saynts are made Kings &amp; Preiſts vnto God: &amp; as Kings they excerciſe a regiment, as Preiſts they performe their Sacrifices Revel. 1.6, 1. Co. 6.1-9.1. Pet. 2.5. &amp; therein they performe homage to the Lord, &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit their conſciences to be wrought vppon. &amp; ſeing the conſcience muſt bow only to the Lord, &amp; not to man otherwiſe then in the Lord, therfor in matter of Religion the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience is not to yeeld to any thing deviſed by man: but muſt alwayes have the Lord for the leader &amp; Governor therein: hence then it foloweth that whoſoever ſubſtituteth any deviſe of man, any thing taught by the precept of man: Mat. 15.9. Eſay 29.13. any will worship, or any ordinance of the world in matter of Religion, ſetteth vp that which is contrary to the Lords ordinance, contrary to the Lords wil, contrary to the Lords wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; I would fayne learne whither this be not an Idol or jmage: So that Idols are of two ſorts: 1. A falſe God, 2, A falſe meanes to honor or ſubmit, or doe homage to the true God in or by: as a falſe or deviſed tyme, place, perſon, inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, action, &amp; if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>be any thing of the like conſideration: therfor a falſe or deviſed tyme may be caled an Idol day as 1, King. 12.33. the month which Ieroboam appointed for the worship of his Calves is called the month which he had forged of his owne hart, that is an Idol moneth &amp; ſo by conſequent the 15 days of that moneth an Idol day. So in the old Teſtament the place where God was to be worshipped was the Tabernacle or Temple. Deut. 12.5-8. &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>for the high places in iudah alſo Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Bethel in Iſrael were Idol places bicauſe they were places forged out of the harts of them that firſt appointed them: ſuch were al the places dedicated by the hethen to worship their Gods in, which therfor were commaunded to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3153:9"/>deviſe of man is called a foolish or Idol Shepheard: Zach. 11.17. Such were Ieroboams Preiſtst 1. King. 12.31. &amp; the falſe Apoſtles, 2.

Thus we ſee the firſt point what an Idol is, &amp; by conſequent that Idols are infinite in nomber, &amp; that they are not only 47. as Mr. Bern. fayth Marlorat reckeneth them: &amp; againe that Mr. Bern. queſtion is anſwered which he maketh pag. 152. What Idol worship wee Saith Mr. Bern? I anſwer that Mr. Bern. doth both worship an Idol, &amp; worshippeth in or by Idols: The Idol which he worshippeth is a falſe Chriſt, who is neither a King to him, ſeing he ſubmitreth not to his kingdome &amp; ordinances thereof, nor a Preiſt, ſeing he yeeldeth not to his true Miniſterie, nor a Prophet, ſeing he receaveth not the Holy doctryne which he teacheth: but yeeldeth to a Kingdom, Preiſhood &amp; Prophecy erected &amp; eſtablished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the doctryne &amp; commaundements of men: as shalbe ſufficiently cleered heare after &amp; hath been o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t tymes already done: The Idols wherein &amp; wherby he worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, is, 1. his owne falſe Church, 2. his owne falſe ſtanding as a meber of the falſe church 3. his owne falſe Miniſtery, 4. his owne falſe parish Church, or Idol Temple, 5. his ſervice book, 6. his Lords the Prelates, their courts, &amp; miniſters wherin &amp; wherto he ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. Generally: look how many Prelates, Preiſts, Deacons, Parishes, Temples, Service books, Surplices, Croſſes, Holy dayes, Courts Eccleſiaſtical, Officers in theſe Courts ther are in the Land: So many Idols there are: that wee may ſay as Eſay ſaid in his tyme of Iudah, Eſay, 2.8. their land is ful of Idols. &amp; ſo this queſtion of yours Mr. Bern. is anſwered: Now the ſecond point to be manifeſted is. VVhat is Real: I oppoſed Real to mentall as may be ſeen Princip Inferenc. pag. 9. &amp; 10. Mental or intellictual is that which hath his being in the mynd or vnderſtanding: as the frame of the English Churches conceaved in the mynd, I called a mental Idol: Real is that which hath an exiſtence &amp; being out of the mynd &amp; conceipt: as the Parish Church of workſop, whereof Mr Bern. is vicar, is a real Idol, having exiſtence, &amp; being not only in the mynd &amp; conceipt, but alſo in deed &amp; truth. Now Real is eyther Natural, or Moral, or Artificial, or Political. Natural as a man, Moral as vertue, Artificial as a howſe, Political as a Cittie or common wealth, &amp; whereas I called a falſely conſtituted Church a real Idol, I intended it a real Politique Idol: For ſo a Church is a politie, Cittie, or common wealth. Revel. 11.2, &amp; 18.2. VVherefore as the true Church is the Holy Cittie the new Ieruſalem that commeth downe from God out of heaven: Revel. 21.2. Even that true Politie &amp; common wealth of Iſrael, Eph. 2.12. So the falſe Church is Babylon, Egipt, Sodom, that Cittie, Politie, common wealth, or Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Sathan: &amp; ſo a Political Real Idol: &amp; therfor the English aſſemblies being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be falſe Churches, are real Idols. Let vs in the next place conſider what Mr. Bern. ſaith to theſe things: Firſt he ſaith the Scripture never taketh an Idol in this ſenſe: I have both in this Section of my lettre, alſo in this Parallele shewed him already that an Idol is ſo taken in the Scripture, but for further evidence I uſe this argument.</p>
                  <p>That which is contrary to a true Church is an Idol.</p>
                  <p>A falſely conſtituted Church is contrary to a truly conſtituted Church.</p>
                  <p>Ergo: A falſely conſtituted Church is an Idol.</p>

                  <p> The Major is true by natural reaſon as alſo by the conſideration of the nature of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traries: For as light is contrary to darknes, vertue to vice: white to black: fire to water: So is true contrary to falſe, &amp; a true Church, to a falſe Church.</p>
                  <p>The major is the Apoſtles owne argument, 2. Cor. 6.16. his wordes are: what agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath the Temple of God with Idols? whence I reaſon thus:</p>
                  <p>That which is contrary to the Temple of God, is an Idol.</p>
                  <p>That which is contrary to the true Church, is contrary to the Temple of God</p>
                  <p>For the true Church is the Temple of God.</p>
                  <p>Ergo: That which is contrary to the true Church is an Idol.</p>
                  <p>Herevppon it followeth that ſeing the Apoſtle oppoſeth an Idol to the temple of God as he oppoſeth light to darknes, Chriſt to Belial: &amp; ſeing the Temple of God is the true Church, therfor an Idol in that place is a falſe Church: now Mr. Bern, with al your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning avoyde this place, &amp; I wil yeeld you this particular.</p>
                  <p>Further, A falſe Chriſt is an Idol.</p>
                  <p>A falſe Church is a falſe Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, a falſe Church is an Idol.</p>
                  <p>The Major is vndeniable.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is proved two wayes: Firſt by the contrary thus:</p>
                  <p>A true Church is true Chriſt as may be collected from theſe two places, 1. Cor. 12.12 Gal. 3, 16.</p>
                  <p>Therfor a falſe Church is a falſe Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it may be proved by Chriſts owne wordes, Mat. 24.24. ther shal ariſe falſe Chriſts, &amp; falſe Prophets, that is to ſay falſe churches, &amp; falſe Miniſters which profeſſe &amp; teach doctrynes of the Lord Ieſus falſely, both of his perſon &amp; offices as the Arrians, the Lutherane vbiquitiſts, the Papiſts, the Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. Thus you ſee wee have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vnto you now this ſecond tyme that a falſely conſtituted Church is a real Idol. But bicauſe you cannot ſoundly anſwer, therfor blaſphemouſly you ſcoffe at the doctryne of the conſtitution of the true Church, wee doe conſtantly &amp; bouldly defend that out of a Church truly conſtituted (when a man can &amp; may joyne therto) no ordinance of God can be accepted, neyther preaching, nor praying, nor Sacraments, nor any other religious action. what the Lord accepteth in ſecreat that we diſpute not: but what the word of God teacheth vnto vs to be acceptable that wee ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>And tel me Mr. Bernard, can ther be a true miniſtery, a true baptiſme, a true faith, true prayer, true preaching, or adminiſtring the L. ſupper true excommunication in the church that is falſely conſtituted? did the L. accept of the Sacraments &amp; Sacrifices of the Church of Iſrael conſtituted by Ieroboam that author of Idolatry? doth not the Lord ſay vnto that people in that falſe Church, Lo, Ammi, Lo, Ruhamah, No People, No Pitie, Hoſea, 1.6.9. &amp; is not the Lord as ſevere now againſt a Church falſely conſtituted in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as he was againſt the falſe Church of the ten tribes in the old Teſtament? or do you think that the Lord accepteth of a falſe ſaith, miniſtery, baptiſme, prayer, preaching, excommunication &amp; the reſt? make theſe things agree Mr. Bern. if you can: if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, ceaſe your ſcoffing, &amp; give glory vnto God: I demaund of you: do you think that God accepteth the prayers &amp; Religious exerciſes of the Papiſts, the Arrians, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3153:10"/>the Familiſts, or any other heretiques or Antichriſtians, if not what is the true cauſe that God accepteth them not? is it not for that ther is not that true communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Saynts there, the true Church, the true ſpouſe of Chriſt, the Spiritual Temple where God hath proviſed his preſence? So then it followeth invincibly that a tiue conſtitution of a church, that is a true communion of Saynts, is that only lawful religious, ſociety, or communion of men, wherby God wilbe honoured, wherin he wilbe ſerved, &amp; wherto he hath promiſed his preſence &amp; acceptance: &amp; as conventicles are vnlawful aſſemblies of men in civil ſtates, ſo are al falſe churches vnlawful eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies &amp; the actions therein performed vnlawful, &amp; ſo abhominable in the ſight of God, the ſumme of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> breefly thus much.</p>
                  <p>That communion of men wherto God hath given the covenant: the Holy things the promiſes, Chriſt for King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophett, is only accepted, &amp; their Eccloſiaſticall actions only acceptable: But a true viſible church, that is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saynts, joyned together in the true covenant, is that only communion of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherto God hath given his covenant, his promiſes, his holy things, Chriſt for King, Preiſt &amp; Prophet.</p>
                  <p>Therfor a true viſible church, that is a communion of Saynts, &amp; their actions eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, as preaching &amp; prayers, &amp;c. are only accepted. &amp; by conſequent on the contrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>That communion of men wherto God hath not given the covenant, the holy things the promiſes, Chriſt for King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophet, is not accepted of God, neither their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions eccleſiaſtical are acceptable.</p>
                  <p>A Church falſely conſtituted (as in the old Teſtament was the Apoſtate church of the ten tribes, &amp; in the new Teſtament is the churches of Antichriſt) is ſuch a communion of men, wherto God hath not given the covenant, the holy things, the promiſes, Chriſt for King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophet.</p>
                  <p>Therfor a church falſely conſtituted is not accepted of God, neither are their actions eccleſiaſtical, as prayer, preaching, &amp;c. acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Herevppon I conclude not as Mr. Bern. blaſphemouſly ſcoffeth that the Idol or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe conſtitution, but that the true conſtitution of a Church which is the Lords Holy ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is that which Sanctifieth al eccleſiaſtical actions: &amp; that a falſe idolatrous, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian conſtitution of a church, corrupteth, polluteth, ſtayneth al the eccleſiaſtical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that falſe church: So ſaith the Apoſtle, vnto the pure al things are pure: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are defiled &amp; vnbeleeving is nothing pure. Tit. 1.15. &amp; this is my welbelo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved ſonne (ſaith the Father from heaven) in whome I am wel pleaſed, Mat. 3.17. &amp; God heareth not ſynners, but only the true worshippers: Ioh. 9.31.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I avouch that a falſely conſtituted church is a greater &amp; more abhominable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, then any Idol that poſſibly can be in a true church: For a falſe worship, Miniſtery &amp; government may be indeed in a true Church through ignorance &amp; the like occaſions: But a true miniſterie, worship &amp; government cannot poſſiblie be in a falſe Church: For the true Miniſterie, worship, &amp; Government are the Holy things of God, which are not given to falſe Churches, but only to the true Churches of Chriſt, the true communion of Saynts: &amp; a falſe Church being an Idol doth conveigh her idolatrous &amp; falſe conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a poiſon through all her Eccleſiaſticall actions or workes off communion:

               <p>The true Church in the Scripture is called the houſe of God, Heb. 3.6.</p>
               <p>The Temple of God which the L. inhabiteth, &amp; wherin he walketh. 2. Cor. 6.16.</p>

               <p>The Kingdome of heaven of Chriſt &amp; of God, Eph. 5.5. Mat. 3.2. Luk. 19.11.12. Act. 1.3. Further this true Church is but of one shape, forme, fashion, or conſtitution: Eph. 4.4 The body that is the Church is one, that is of one shape: For one in that place ſignfieth vnum ſpecie, not vnum numero, for ther are many Churches in nomber, but one true Church in the frame or conſtitution: Let this therfor be ſet downe for an invincible truth that the true viſible Church is the Kingdome of Chriſt, wher Chriſt the King only ruleth &amp; raigneth in his owne lawes &amp; officers &amp; over his owne ſubjects: &amp; al thoſe that wil not be ſubiects to this King in this his Kingdome he accunteth his enemies &amp; wil have them ſlayne before his face Luk. 19.27. Hence then it followeth that thoſe that are not members of a true conſtituted Church, are not ſubjects of Chriſts Kingdome: which you ſay is error, wherin you ſee you give the Holy Ghoſt the lie, imputing error vnto the word of truth: But you wil ſay if men be not ſubjects of Chriſts Kingdome, ther is no ſalvation for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deny that: wil you condemne al the Iewes, Turkes, Papiſts

Speaking of the ſame matter, viz: of Abrahams faith that it was made perfect by works: for if Abrahams faith had not been manifeſted by his workes, it had been inviſible, &amp; it would not have been diſcerned by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; therfor in the ſame place vſ. 14. the Ap. ſpeaketh directly of a viſible faith this place of the Ap. therfor confirmeth my aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plainly, that they that are not of a true conſtituted Church, are no ſubjects of Chr.

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:3153:13"/>but if they have faith they have it with God, &amp; not with man, who can judg only by the fruites.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond place is, 1. Ioh. 3.14 where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh thus: VVee know we are tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated from death to life, bicauſe we love the brethren? VVho are the brethren, are not they that cal God Father? who can cal God Father but they that have Chriſt for their Lord &amp; Mr. for their Elder brother? To whome is Chriſt Lord &amp; Mr. but to them that are ſubjects of his Kingdome? So that this place alſo maketh moſt evidently for the confirmation of this truth of God which I defend. But you Mr. Bern. dreame of am viſible faith, of an inviſible Kingdome, of an inviſible brotherhood or conſanguinity: whereas Chriſt ſaith directely, that they which doe the wil of God, are his brethren &amp; of his Fra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ternity, Marc. 3.35. &amp; what have we to do with things inviſible, hidden, &amp; ſecreat, Deut. 29.29. I avouch that you cannot prove to me by any rule of Gods word certaynly, that thoſe that are not members of a true conſtituted Church, are ſubjects of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome inviſible as you I am ſure intend it: Further, what is the love of the brethren wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle ſpeaketh? is it not a viſible love teſtified in the performance of the viſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ioh. 3.17. whoſoever hath this worlds good, &amp; ſeeth his brother need, &amp; chutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? So the viſible dutyes of brotherly love are the true touchſtone of brotherly love: but the principal viſible dutyes of brotherly love are the dutyes of admonition, conſolation, ſupportation, patience. 1. Theſ. 5.14. Exhortation, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, vs. 11. among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> admonition is moſt excellent. Mat. 18.15-17. compared with Levit. 19.17. they therfor that altogether omit theſe viſible dutyes of admonition in the degrees thereof injoyned by Chriſt &amp; the Apoſtles, how can they be ſaid to love the brethren? but al they that live out of a true conſtituted Church wholy omit the viſible dutyes of love to the brethren, ſeing they neyther know, nor have brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome they may exerciſe theſe dutyes: Therfor this place of the Apoſtle is pregnant &amp; invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly ſtrong againſt you.</p>
                  <p>The third place is 1. Cor. 1.1. Now what wordes Mr. Bern, intendeth in this place I can not conjecture except they be theſe: viz. in the ſecond verſe: with al thoſe that cal vpon the name of the L.

                  <p>The third place therfor is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The laſt place is 2. Theſ. 3.15. &amp; count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</p>
                  <p>To paſſe by what ſome think of this place, I ſay vnto you Mr. Bern: that it hath not ſo much as a shew for your purpoſe: The Apoſtle ſpeaketh in this verſe negatively &amp; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively. For he teacheth that they ought not to recken of an excommunicate, as they account of an enemy, but they are to admonish an excommunicate as they doe admonish a brother: Therby teaching vs that an exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate is in a midle condition neyther an enemy nor a brother, but one that is vnder the cenſure of the church, as a meanes ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God for his reformation how wil this place prove that an excommunicate is a member of Chriſts inviſible Kingdome? or if it should prove that ſome excommunicate are members of Chriſts inviſible Kingdome, how can you prove that this or that excom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municate is ſo? do you know the Lords Elect certaynly, &amp; particularly, that are out of the church? Or what doth this aſſertion of yours, &amp; this place of Scripture againſt my aſſertion? who ſay, that ſuch as are not of a true conſtituted church, are no ſubjects of Chriſts Kingdome: viz: Of the Kingdome which he shal give vp into the hands of his Father in the day of his final judgment,</p>
                  <p>In the third place Mr. Bern. asketh what may be ſaid of wicklife, Hus, Luther, Bucer, Melanchtho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Martyrs, Gods people in England, of Lot, Iob, the people in captivity in Mordecay his tyme: wherto I anſwer as I have already done: That Iob was a member of a true conſtituted church, &amp; ſo a ſubject of Chriſts Kingdome, So was Lot, ſo were the people of the Iewes in captivity, though violently deteyned from the Holy land, Cittie &amp; Temple: &amp; therfor Mr. Bern. in theſe three demaundes gaineth nothing except the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ignorance &amp; folly be gaine: to that of the Martyrs, Hus, Luther, &amp; Gods people in England, I ſay two things: eyther that in affection &amp; deſire they aperteyned to the true viſible church being ſeperated from the falſe church: or that they were of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church, &amp; of the inviſible Kingdome which is vnknowne to man, &amp; the members therof vnknowne: diſprove you this if you can.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place you demaund, whither Chriſts Kingdom be not Spiritual &amp; inviſible alſo? Ioh. 18.33. &amp; 10.16.</p>
                  <p>The two places of Scripture quoted by you do not prove that Chriſt hath an inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdome, &amp; ſo inviſible ſubjects knowne to vs, For Ioh. 18. Chriſt ſaith my Kingdom is not of this world, that is to ſay: it is not begunne, continued, &amp; perfected by worldly meanes: So Chriſt expoundeth himſelf, afterward ſaying: my Kingdom is not from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: my ſubjects would fight for mee vſ. 36. meaning that his Kingdom is neyther erected nor ſupported by worldly meanes as by ſword, ſpeare or shield: in reſpect whereof the Apoſtle ſaith Rom. 14.17. The Kingdome of God is not meate nor drinck, &amp; 2. Cor. 10.3.4. Though we live in the flesh, yet we do not warre after the flesh for the weapens of our warfare are not carnal The ſecond place is Ioh. 10. VVher Chriſt ſaith not as you dreame very ignorantly &amp; childishly, that he hath an inviſible Kingdome, but that he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3153:14"/>hath sheep of two ſorts, ſome of the viſible Church of the Old Teſtament, which is one fold, ſome of the viſible Church of the New Teſtament, which is another ſold o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Iewes &amp; Gentils: both which ſorts of people shal in Chriſt Ieſus, the partition wal being taken away, be joyned, &amp; made one that ſo ther may be one sheepfold &amp; one shepheard, but what is al this Mr. Bern. to diſprove the truth of my poſition? Again to anſwer your demaund, I ſay that Chr. Kingdome is Spiritual &amp; inviſible aſwel as outward &amp; viſible: For when we ſay that Chriſts Kingdome is viſible &amp; ſenſible, we do not deny that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inviſible &amp; Spiritual: neyther are theſe two contraryes to be opoſed, as excluding one another: For as a man is not only the body which is viſible &amp; ſenſible, but cheefly &amp; principally the ſoule which is inviſible: &amp; as the true Sacraments are not only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Elements, but the inward grace alſo, &amp; that moſt eſpecialy: So the viſible Church which conſiſteth of men, is not only the outward communion, but eſpecially &amp; cheefly the inward &amp; Spiritual fellowship which the Saynts have with Chriſt, &amp; one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Apoſtle therfor ſaith both that ther is one body &amp; one Spirit: Eph. 4. &amp; that al that are baptized are baptized into one body, &amp; al that communicate are cauſed to drinck into one Spirit, 1. Cor. 12.13. And as the Saynts are members of Chriſts body, of his flesh, &amp; of his bones, Eph. 5.30. So they that are joyned to the Lord are one Spiritt: 1. Cor. 6.17. we grant you therfor Mr. Bern. that Chriſts Kingdome is Spiritual &amp; viſible, but we deny that Chriſts Kingdome is only inviſible, or only viſible: he that doth plead to me that he is a member of Chriſts viſible Kingdome, &amp; yet cannot shew vnto me his fayth by his workes, I ſay vnto him as Iames ſaith: VVhat avayleth it him? o thou vaine man? shal thy ſayth ſave the? thy ſayth is dead: &amp; he that shal plead with the Lord in the day of his judgment, that he hath propheſyed in Chriſts name, &amp; by his name caſt out Devils, &amp; wrought many great workes, given his body to be burned in the fire, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven al his goodes to the poore, hath ſpoken with the tongs of men &amp; aungels, wanting true inward love &amp; faith the Lord wil ſay vnto him depart thou worker of iniquity, I know the not: al this outward shew was hypocriſy: &amp; thou art but as ſounding braſſe, &amp; a tinckling Cymbal. Therfor as the Apoſtle ſaith: glorifie God with your body and Spirit, for they are Gods: 1. Cor. 6.20. he that is only an inviſible member of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome, is but half a ſubject of Chriſts Kingdome at the vtmoſt, though it be the better half: &amp; he that is only a viſible member of Chriſts Church, he is vnto vs truly &amp; fully a ſubject of Chriſts Kingdome, though vnto the Lord he is but half, &amp; ſo the worſe half, &amp; ſo as good as nothing: Let the Lord judg in ſecret what he pleaſeth in mercy, but wee muſt judg in viſible that which we ſee viſiblie, &amp; therfor to conclude this Parallele: I ſay he that pleadeth himſelf to be a true ſubject of Chriſts Kingdome by his inviſible fayth, yet ſtanding in confuſion with the world in the falſe Church, worship, miniſtery &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, let him be what he may be vnto the Lord, to me he is eyther an Antichriſtian or Fameliſt: &amp; he that wanting true faith only in ſecreat knowne to the Lord, is yet a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber of a true Church, though I muſt needes ſay vnto him thou art holy, faithful, &amp; Elect, yet the Lord wil cal him an Hypocrite, &amp; a worker of iniquity in the day when he will bring vnto light every ſecreat thing whither good or evil: Therfor my poſition ſtandeth firme notwithſtanding al your cavils, that he that is not of a true conſtituted Church is no ſubject of Chriſts Kingdome.</p>

               <p>In the next place followeth your eighth poſition which you account error, viz.</p>
               <p>That ſuch as are not in your way are to be accounted whithout after the Apoſtles meaning, 1. Cor. 5.12.</p>
               <p>I take it to be moſt evidently true vppon the former groundes, that ſeing the true vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſible Church is Chriſts sheepfold, his Kingdome, his howſe, his houſehold or family, his Temple or Tabernacle, his body: That therfor al thoſe that are not within this sheepfold this Kingdome, howſe, family, Temple, body, are without: For they are either within or without, but they are not within: go: they are without: Now for the Apoſtles meaning in that place of the 1. Cor. 5.12. I do alſo take it to be manifeſt that he aymeth not only at the groſſe Idolaters in paganiſme, but at al manner of vnbeleevers, that is both Iewes &amp; Gentils that did not embrace the ſaith: now theſe perſons were of 4. ſorts, 1. perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pagans, 2. civil pagans, 3. perſecuting Iewes, 4. the Iewes that were Zealous &amp; vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable in the law of Moſes, (as was Paul) &amp; yet refuſed Chriſt: Such as the Apopſtle ſpeaketh of Rom. 10. 1.2.3. VVho have the Zeale of God, but not according to knowledg who ſought to eſtablish their owne righteouſnes &amp; did not ſubmit to the righteouſnes of God: al theſe 4. ſorts of perſons were then without the true viſible Church of the Apoſtolique inſtitution, which is called the Kingdome of God: Now whereas you ſay wee doe account al without that are not of our way, I anſwer two things. Firſt, that all the members of every true Church in the world wee doe account within. Secondly, that al the members of falſe Churches wee doe indeed account without: &amp; therefore we doe account your particular Church at workſop to be without: For it is not the true conſtituted Church of Chriſt, &amp; therfor it is a falſe Church, &amp; therfor without ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording as the holy Ghoſt teſtifieth, the court that is without the Temple caſt out: Apoc. 11.2. Now you know that in the old Teſtament al ſorts of people good &amp; bad came into the vtter court: but now in the new Teſtament, Iohn by viſion was commaunded to caſt that vtter court out &amp; not to meaſure it, bicauſe it is given to the Gentils who shal tread the Holy Cittie vnder foot: &amp; now only the true viſible Church, which is the Temple of God: 2. Cor. 6.16. conſiſteth of a holy people which muſt come out from the vnrighteous &amp; vnbeleevers that are Belial even without the yoke of the L. ordinances: &amp; muſt be a Seperated people: And muſt have no followship nor agreement with vnrighteouſnes, not touch any vncleane thing: &amp; ſuch a people the L. promiſeth to receave to be his owne people &amp; no other: I avouch therfor that ſeing you parish Church wherof you are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish preiſt conſiſteth of a confuſed rowt even ſuch a people as came into the vtter court in the old Teſtament, that therfor by the commaundement of the Lord your parish church muſt be caſt out &amp; not meaſured. &amp; therfor it is without &amp; ſo are all ſuch aſſemblies as yours is: what ſay you Mr. Bern. now? either juſtifie your Church or forſake it: Let vs heer what anſwer you make to this matter: for I geſſe it toucheth your freehold very neer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: but I proceed.</p>

Iudah, Sodom, &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria are ſiſters in ſinne &amp; punishment, &amp; Iudah hath juſtified Sodom.</p>
                  <p>Therfor, Scriptures directed againſt pagans may be applyed by proportion eyther of equality or ſuperiority againſt Antichriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Now for your further inſtruction in this point Mr. Bern. conſider that in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament the phraſes, ſpeeches titles, priviledges &amp; benefites of the Church of the Iewes, conſidered as the true Church are ordinarily applyed to the viſible Church of Chriſt in the new Teſtament: &amp; contrariwiſe the phraſes, ſpeeches, titles, priviledges, &amp; judgments pronounced agaiſt the Gentils in the old Teſtament are cuſtomabley applyed againſt the falſe Churches &amp; Antichriſtians in the new Teſtament: Hence it is that the true viſible Church of the new Teſtament is called the holy Cittie, Temple, Tabernacle, the new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem &amp; the like, &amp; the falſe Church is called the Gentils, Egipt, Sodom, Babylon, &amp;c. the reaſon whereof is bicauſe that the Church of the Iewes was a type of the Churches of the new Taſtament, ſo the aſſemblies of the Gentils were types of the falſe Churches of Antichriſt: as you may ſee through the whole book of the revelation in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: which point if you had eyther vnderſtood or attended, you could not thus fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſly have objected to vs this one particular, that ſpeeches vnderſtood of pagans may not be applyed againſt Antichriſtians: I pray you what vſe do you make of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the old Teſtament againſt Nineveh, Babylon, Elam, Madai, &amp; the reſt? VVhat vſe can you make of the judgments threatned &amp; inflicted vppon the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils if not this that Chriſt &amp; the Apoſtles make, Mat. 11.22.24. &amp; 12.41.42. 2. Pet. 2.5-7.15. Iude. 7.11. Heer I know you will ſay that you are not Antichriſtians, &amp; ſo though theſe places may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed againſt Antichriſtians, yet not againſt you: that particular wee will ſee afterward in his proper place: in the meane tyme thus much we have gayned that places af Scripture directed againſt pagans may as wel be applyed againſt Antichriſtians, as places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true ſpoken to the true Church of the Iewes may be applyed to the true Church of the new Teſtament.</p>

                  <p>Now Mr. Bern. I have proved by playne Scripture, that Antichriſtian aſſemblies are without: &amp; I know you wil not denye it: but you wil plead that your Churches are not Antichriſtian aſſemblies, &amp; therfor you account that one of our errors pag. 109. viz: our 8. error as you ſumme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that poſition therfor: viz: your Churches are falſe Churches shalbe proved vnto you fully in the Paralleles, Cenſures, Obſervations aperteyning to the 10. ſection of this lettre, whither I referre the reader deſiring him for his information &amp; ſatisfaction in that particular to read that Section before he proceed any further in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, leſt it should be thought that <hi>I</hi> deceave &amp; shift of thys mayne point, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the cheef &amp; moſt principal of our cauſe &amp; Seperation.</p>
                  <p>The third thing that you object is, that God Almightie hath witneſſed that you are his people: by giving you his word, &amp; Sacraments, by effectual converſion, by his ſtrange &amp; miraculous delivering you: theſe things Mr. Ainſworth hath anſwered moſt fully, &amp; hath ſtopt your mouth for ever that you shal never be able to mutter any more in this matter: &amp; therfor I wil ſpare my paynes.</p>

Revel. 14.9. &amp; al this the Lord performeth by our teſtimony. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe we ſay that your aſſemblies Eccleſiaſtical are falſe Churches that they are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Epipt, Sodom, where Lot &amp; the Lords people are kept captives: &amp; by reaſon of the preſence of Gods people with you, therfor it is that you have thoſe many delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which you have, even as the Lord gave Paul the lives of al that Sayled with him in the Ship: Act. 27.24, &amp; whereas you plead you have the word, Sacraments &amp; converſion, I ſay it is but as the theef hath the true mans purſe, &amp; as the falſe Church of Ieroboam had, &amp; as the Samaritanes, the Edomitts, Moabites, Ammonites, &amp; Ishmaelites had cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion &amp; the Sacrifices by vſurpation: which by continuance of tyme were at the laſt worne out among them: even ſo you ſee Mr. Bern. that Gods people, the ſincereſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by the forwardeſt among you, &amp; the conſcionable practiſe of the truth by the beſt profeſſors, &amp; the reformation which the reformiſts ſo long have ſought is almoſt expired &amp; out of date in the Land: The Prelates, Subſcription, Conformity, Declining to Popery, &amp; a Linſy wolſey Religion prevayleth in the Land: &amp; you your ſelfe among the reſt have loſt or forſaken your ſincerity, &amp; are become a Tymeſerver, a Newter, a Temporizer, &amp; then what els but an Hypocrite? &amp; except the Lord be mercifull vnto his people among you, it is likely to come to paſſe among you as among the Samaritanes, Edomites; Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Ammonites, Iſhmaelites, that the Holy things of God which by violence &amp; vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation you have invaded wilbe eyther overwhelmed with Egiptian darknes, or vtterly banished out of the nation: &amp; I would fayne know whither even at this preſent, ther be not a thouſand parishes in the Land, wher ther is no more true profeſſion of Chriſt then among the Antichriſtian Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>Finaly, to conclude this Parallele: whereas you object that wee like it that you call vs brethren, but we wil not ſo account you nor admonish you as brethren: I anſwer that we like it to be counted brethren by you, nor for that wee are ſo vnto you: but for that here by wee would judg you out of your owne mouths: that whereas you account vs Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, Schiſmaticks, Heretiques, Traytors, &amp;c. you may hereby perceave your wicked ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders, that thus intitle vs, &amp; yet account vs your Brethren: For otherwiſe as we deteſt your Church, miniſtery, worship, &amp; Government as Antichriſtian: So alſo wee have in abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination your brotherhood, which is Antichriſtian: alſo wee abjure to be brethren to your Lords the Prelates, to your vice Lords the Archdeacons, Chancellors, Comiſtaries, Officials of their Courts, to the damned crew ſo termed in the Land, to your Church Papiſts, to the adulterers, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To forſake all knowne ſinne, 2. to doe all the will of God knowne. 3. to grow in grace. 4. to continue to the end: For the further cleering of this point conſider that al the members of the true viſible Church of the Apoſtolique inſtitution are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are to be accounted, holy faithful &amp; elect: now if they be elect, I hope they wil continue faithful to the end: but you wil happily object that many fal away by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy: true &amp; then they are fit to be entertayned in your churches as ſome of ours have been: of them I ſay as the Apoſtle Iohn ſaith, if they had been of vs they would have con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinued with vs: Therfor they were none of vs: For although they were in the outward communion, yet they were not of the true viſible Church, but were only Hipocrites, &amp; as ſuperfluous excreſcences in the body no natural true parts of the body: For as in the matural body an eie of glaſſe is not indeed a true part of the body, though it occupie the place or a natural part: So an Hypocrite or one that continueth not to the end poſſeſſeth only a rome in the viſible Church, &amp; is not indeed a true member. You wil demaund then why we receave Hypocrites among vs: wherto I anſwer we cannot diſcerne an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, &amp; therfor we are to judg of men according to that we ſee meaſuring them by the word of God: That which is concealed from vs wee are not to prie into: VVherfor our judgment muſt alter &amp; chang as occaſions varie: &amp; ſo the Scripture ſpeaketh of a righteous man forſaking his righteouſnes, Ezech. 18.24.

                     </gap> 2. I anſwer more properly thus: when I define Saynts I muſt define them not as they are in shew for the preſent, but as they are indeed &amp; truth: Now truth is ſo eyther before men or before God: before men that is true ſomtyme which is falſe before God: &amp; before God that is true ſomtyme which is falſe before men: That is true before men which is proved by two or three witneſſes. Mat. 18.16. He therfor is a Saynt before men in truth, that continueth to the end in faith repentance &amp; the fruites thereof: He is a Saynt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am not therefore to define a Saynt as he is in shew for the preſent, but as he is indeed for ever in the judgment of men: neither do I define a Saynt as he is in the Lords knowledg which is not revealed to men, but as he is revealed to be judged by the word of God: I wil declare this by inſtances for your further information &amp; ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Stephen: Damas: Tertullus: Stephen continued to the end: Demas embraced the world &amp; fel back from the truth: Tertullus never came to the truth for ought that is revealed: I ſay, Stephen was a true member of the viſible Church who continued to the end: Demas was no Saynt nor no true member of the viſible Church indeed, but only in shew: Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus was no Saynt nor true member of the viſible church ſo much as in shew or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance what Tertullus was in ſecreat to the Lord I diſpute not, nor regard not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas was, what Stephen was in the Lords counſel it doth not aperteyne vnto vs: we muſt judg according to that we ſee &amp; know: I ſay ſtill with the Apoſtle continuance is a true propertie of a Saynt &amp; member of the viſible Church indeed &amp; truth, &amp; of the ful &amp; compleat communion thereof, 1.

                  <p>Your ſecond Objection &amp; reaſon is that by this my definition of Saynts, or the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the viſible Church ſo determined, I exclude the members of the viſible Church of the old Teſtament, as Hezechiah, David, Ichoſaphat, Moſes, &amp;c.

In the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the materiall Temple was made of material ſtones: in the New Teſtament the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church is made of living &amp; Spiritual ſtones, 1. Pet. 2.5. in the old Teſtament the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that offered ſacrifice were a holy people literally, Deut. 14.2.3. in the new Teſtament the people that worship God muſt be holy indeed &amp; ſpiritualy, 1. Pet. 2.5.9. the ſame may be ſaid or the ſacrifices, ſacrificers or Preiſts &amp; of al other ordinances of the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: hence it foloweth by a neceſſary conſequence that the conſtitution of the church of the old teſtament was a ceremonial conſtitution: the worship of the old teſtament a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nial worship: the miniſtery a typical miniſtery: the government a typical government: the people a typical people: the land or country a ceremonial country. &amp; ſo forth of the reſt by proportion This being propounded &amp; confirmed thus as the vndoubted truth of God diſcovereth the vanity of your reaſon: I ſay vnto you that David, Iehoſaphat, &amp; the reſt of the Godly in the old teſtament though they did ſuffer known ſin in the land, yet were the true matter of the typical Church being typicaly or ceremonialy cleane: For to the conſtitution of the typical Church ther was not required true holynes, but ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial cleanenes: &amp; although it was ſignified vnto them of the old teſtament, &amp; neceſſarily required of them for their aceptation befor God that they should be truly, holy, &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: (for never was any accepted before God without true inward holines) yet it was not neceſſarily required of them to the conſtitution of their Church, for to make them true matter or members of that typical Church, or to fit them to that typical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion which was the proper co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of that typical Church, &amp; of that typical ſervice. Hence it is that as in the old teſtament a Saint was a typical Saint, ſo an hipocrite was a typicall hipocrite: &amp; a wicked man was a typical wicked man, &amp; therfor excommunication was typical: Nomb. 5.2-4. &amp; 12.14. Hence alſo it foloweth that lawfully they might have ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical communion in typical worship that were typicaly cleane or ſaynts typicaly though they were wicked indeed: For their real wickednes did not polute their ceremonial or ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pical Church, worship, &amp; communion, although it did polute their owne conſciences &amp; workes Their ceremonial vncleanes did polute their ceremonial communion: Their moral vncleanes did not ſo: If their communion had been moral &amp; Spiritual, then their moral vncleanes had defiled their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion being only ceremonial &amp; typical, their polution was only of that kind: therfor you shal never find that in the old teſtament the L. chardgeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in their typical ſervice with wicked men, howſoever the wicked men the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves are sharpely reproved for their wickednes. Beſides the nature of their worship being wel weighed doth inſtruct vs thus much: For their worship was reconciliation &amp; repentance to acceptation: but our worship is of another nature, viz: Sacrifices of praiſe &amp; thankſgiving after repentance, reconciliation, &amp; accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For they did worship to repentance, we do worship from repentance: therfor they might &amp; did worship therby to reconcile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to God: we being reconciled to God &amp; accepted in Chriſt do proceed to offer vnto the L. the calves of our lips, the beſt grace
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3153:21"/>we have: with vs men firſt declare their repentance, &amp; then we receave them into our communion to worship with vs: with them firſt men were receaved into typicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, &amp; then they were trayned vp to repentance &amp; faith in Chriſt by the typical ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of that typical communion: Their worship began outwardly in the lettre, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded inwardly to the Spirit, ſo did their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution, miniſtery &amp; al: our worship begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth inwardly in the Spirit, &amp; proceedeth outwardly to the lettre: Therfor our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, miniſtery, worship, &amp; government, is contrary to theirs: &amp; therfor Mr. Bern. if you had knowne or obſerved this, you would not have objected theſe things of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament for the joyning with &amp; ſuffering of open knowne ſinne in the new Teſtament, &amp; the communion thereof: For how can theſe things agree, except you wil make the New Teſtament, the Old Teſtament: &amp; abolish Chriſt, &amp; ſet vp Iudaiſme againe.</p>
                  <p>But I would fayne know how you can prove that theſe holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did ſuffer ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> known ſinne, or ſuffering it were not defiled therby? defiled I ſay not in their communion which was typical, but in their conſent which was Spiritual. But this point I muſt thus leave wayting for your anſwer: For I avouch that either the ſinnes which they ſuffered were not knowne: or if they were knowne they were defiled by them: &amp; ſo not repenting of them, al their worship was defiled to themſelves, but yet being ceremonially cleane their communion in ceremonial worship was not vncleane vnto others. &amp; if you doe object vnto me that their Spiritual communion was polluted vnto others: I anſwer that their moral or Spiritual communion was inviſible, &amp; ſo could not pollute others: &amp; ther viſible communion was typical &amp; ceremonial, &amp; that only polluted others: For ſuch as was ther communion, ſuch was ther pollution: Ther communion viſible being typical did only polute typicaly our communion viſible being moral or Spiritual doth pollute vs moraly &amp; Spiritually. Now I doe confeſſe vnto you, that by ther typical Church, miniſtery, wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship, &amp; government, Spiritual things were ſignified both for them &amp; for vs: For them the morality or Spiritual ſignification was double, viz: 1. that the Lord required that they should be that indeed which was typed vnto them, els they could not be accepted. 2. That in them they ought to ſee as in a glaſſe the glorious condition of the Church, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, worship, &amp; government of the new Teſtament, which were shadowed out by thoſe ceremonies: For vs the moral or Spiritual ſignification is, that except we be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, in our conſtitution, miniſterie, worship, &amp; Government, to thoſe types of the old Teſtament, our conſtitution, miniſterie, worship &amp; government, is either jewish, or paganish, &amp; therfor Antichriſtian: Herevppon thus may I reaſon againſt you moſt ſoundly &amp; therin you Mr. Bern. shal have your mouth ſo ſtopped as that you shal never be able to reply, or once to mutter againſt the truth any more except you have a cauterized con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, viz.</p>
                  <p>If in the Old Teſtament ther viſible typical communion was typically polluted by typical &amp; ceremonial vncleannes vncleanſed: Then in the New Teſtament our Spiritual viſible communion is really poluted by moral vncleanenes vncleanſed, that is, ſinne vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of.</p>
                  <p>But in the old Teſtament, ther viſible typical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion was typicaly poluted by the typical &amp; ceremonial vncleanes vncleanſed.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:3153:21"/>
                  <p> Therfor in the new teſtament our viſible Spiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion is realy poluted by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vncleanes vncleanſed, that is ſinne vnrepented of.</p>
                  <p>The major cannot be denyed for it is a juſt analogie &amp; proportion from the type to the truth, from the shadow to the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The minor is evidently confirmed by theſe places of Scripture, compared together. Nomb. 19.13.20. Hag. 2.14. Act. 21.28.29.</p>
                  <p>Againe: If in the old Teſtament the perſons ceremonialy vncleane during the tyme of their vncleanes, we excluded from the tabernacle or the hoſt of Iſrael: then in the new Teſtament perſons morally vncleane by impenitency, during the tyme of ther impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, muſt be excluded from the communion and fellowſhip of the true viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>But in the old Teſtament perſons ceremonialy vncleane during the tyme of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanes were excluded from the tabernacle or hoſt of Iſrael, as may be ſeen: Nomb. 5.2-4 &amp; 12.14.15. 2. Chron. 26.21.</p>
                  <p>Terfor in the New Teſtament perſons morally vncleane by impenitency, during the tyme of ther impenitency, muſt be excluded from the communion of the true viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>But I shal have better occaſion hereafter, namely in the 8. Section, to manifeſt this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whither I referre the reader.</p>
                  <p>Breeflie I anſwer concerning David his ſuffering of loabs murther: The Kings of Iudah ſuffering the braſen Serpent to be worshipped, &amp; the high places: Moſes giving the bill of divoice: that eyther they knew them not to be ſinne, or if they knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they were polluted therwith by conſent: but yet ther typical communion was not defiled ther by if they were ceremonialy cleane: they therfor being typicaly Saynts were true matter of the typical Church, &amp; for the Church of Corinth, &amp; the Churches of Aſia, I anſwere that they were not impenitent in ſinne, &amp; ſo were Saynts: For know you that not ſinne but impenitency in ſinne maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a falſe matter of a church: making ſaynts no ſaynts Now how can you prove that either the Corinthians or the Churches of Aſia were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent after once &amp; twiſe admonition? I think it paſſeth your skil to prove that, &amp; therfor I think this ſecond objection of yours to be idle &amp; of no value.</p>
                  <p>Your third objection &amp; reaſon is that the places of Scripture which we bring declare what men ought to be not what men are: &amp; you ſay we cannot conclude from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture we bring, that bicauſe men are commaunded ſo to be, therfor if they be not ſo they are none of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>To this objection &amp; reaſon I anſwer: that hereby you confeſſe, that the L. requireth that al the members of the viſible Church should be Saynts: whence I alſo conclude that ſeing they ought ſo to be, therfor if they be not ſo they are otherwiſe then they ought to be, &amp; ſo by conſequent, if the Church be framed of thoſe that are not Saynts, it is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of another matter then the Scripture appointeth: &amp; I would know if that be not a falſe matter. Moreover I avouch flatly contradictory vnto you that if men be not as God commaundeth, they are none of his people: but you are to know that true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the true tryal of a Saynt, or of one of Gods people: &amp; impenitency is an evident declaration that the partie therwith affected is none of Gods people: Therfor you muſt obſerve the difference betwixt the commaundements Legal, &amp; Evangelical: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3153:22"/>legal require abſolute obedience in the higheſt degres therof: The goſpell requireth true &amp; vnfeyned repentance in the beſt degre we can aford: I would not have you think that wee imagine men should beframed in obedience abſolutely according to the exactnes of the low, For wee are not vnder the law: no: wee only hold that men muſt in vnfeyned deſire &amp; endevour yeld obedience to the law, &amp; repent of al that wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in they are defective: &amp; this is the obedience of the goſpel which is acceptable, for wee are vnder grace: wherfor Mr. Bern. if you doe conceave that we intend the moſt perfect obedience of the law as a proper adjunct or formall difference of a Saynt, you are very groſſe in your apprehenſion: if you conceave that we entend that men should be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely according to the goſpel in faith &amp; repentance, or els to be none of Gods people, then your conceipt is true &amp; fit, but your objection is frivolous &amp; ridiculous: For then men either are ſo or none of Gods people, &amp; this doth our places of Scripture which we quote, prove, for any thing you yet have manifeſted to the contrary: when wee ſee you manifeſt otherwiſe, you shal receave anſwer, in the meane tyme you have diſcovered your ſelf to be but a wrangler.</p>
                  <p>Your fourth objection &amp; reaſon is, for that Saints in Scripture are not ſo called, 1. ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſoundnes of knowledg, 2. or internal pure affection, 3. or holy practiſe of their duty alwayes: But, 1.

                  <p>I anſwer you thus: you deny three things &amp; affirme ſix: I doe poremptorily deny your three negatives: &amp; I conſtantly affirme; that ſound knowledg, pure affections, &amp; continual obedience are moſt pregnant and couvertible properties off true Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Soundnes of knowledg is a proper note of life Eternall. Iohn. 17.3. Heb. 8.11. &amp; ſo a true note of Sanctification. Tit. 1.16. &amp; that which you bring of Chriſts Diſciples, being ignorant of many things (which we acknowledg) is nothing for your purpoſe: For you ſpeak not of perfect knowledg, but of ſound knowledg, &amp; that Epithete doth not argue the quantity or perfect meaſure, but the quality or true condition of knowledg which I do avouch by the former groundes to be a true convertible ſigne of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; ſo of a Saynt.</p>
                  <p>Pure affection alſo is another true token of Sanctification. Matt. 5.8. 1. Tim. 1.5, Tit. 1.15. which pure hart or affection is not a hart voyde of ſinn, but of hipocriſy, &amp; for that you object of Paul, Rom. 7.18.21. it is nothing to overthrow his pure affection: For though he had ſinne, yet he know nothing by himſelf, whereof he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</p>
                  <p>Continuall practiſe of Holy dutyes, alſo is a true ſigne of a Saynt, or a Sanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Pſal. 119.101.102.106.112. And although Eccleſiaſtes ſaith that ther is no man without ſinne, vet that hindreth not, but that ſome may continualy practiſe their dutyes, ſith this is the ſumme of al, that by repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; faith which are the continual practiſe of the Saynts, a man doth alwayes performe his duty: &amp; the ſpeech of Ecleſtaſtes is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence of the law, not of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But heerin is your monſtrous fraud and abhominable diſſembling manifeſted, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3153:22"/>vnder theſe doubtful termes of ſound knowledg pure affection &amp; practiſe of duty all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, you would bleare mens eyes that they should not ſee the truth: VVhat doe you think that any of vs would be ſo abſurd as to ſay that perfect knowledg, love, &amp; obedience, without any imperfection or fault are the ſignes of Sanctification? And yet wee ſay, that ſound knowledg, a pure hart, and continual practiſe of Holy dutyes are the moſt infallible tokens of true Saynts, and men truly Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: But you are wholly transformed as I perceave into vayne jangling.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I doe acknowledg that your fix affirmatives are ſomthing to the purpoſe: But nevertheleſſe you have mingled much chaffe with the wheate: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breefly in all that which you write page 85. 86. 87. 88, Concerning this matter I doe obſerve theſe particulars: Namely, 1. That although an outward calling, profeſſion, and baptiſme to the faith be part of the ſignes of Saynts: Namely, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible markes outwardly: yet they muſt be thus qualified, els they are nothing but pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or images, reſembling &amp; shadowing Sanctification ſuperficialy: For they muſt be true &amp; inward alſo: True calling, profeſſion &amp; baptiſme: &amp; inward calling, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; baptiſme, are the infallible tokens of Sanctification and Saynts: The inward muſt be diſcerned by the outward, the truth muſt be judged by the word: He that is ſo called, ſo profeſſeth, is ſo baptiſed as the word teacheth: that is to ſay: He that is called and Seperated from the VVorld, Antichriſtianiſme, &amp; all falſe wayes knowne vnto him: he that profeſſeth that true faith, taught in the New Teſtament of Chriſt, which is but one: he that is baptiſed into that true faith, after that true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Chriſt hath preſcribed, I muſt needs ſay that he is truly called, truly profeſſeth, is truly baptized, and ſo he by reaſon of his outward true calling, true profeſſion of the true faith, and true baptiſme is diſcerned &amp; judged to be inwardly called, inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have faith, to be inwardly baptized, &amp; that truly. A company of men thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, profeſſing, &amp; baptized, are Saynts: But if half ot but ſome of them only be thus, &amp; the reſt impenitent &amp; obſtinate in ſinne, it cannot poſſibly be that they should joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together be a true Church: being light &amp; darkenes, righteouſnes &amp; impenitency, Chriſt and Belial: or being joyned together, thoſe former called, profeſſing, &amp; baptized, doe forſake their righteouſnes, &amp; partake with the wicked in their ſinnes, and ſo shal receave of their plagues: How then can that mixt company be called Saynts, yea they are aſ acceſſary to fearful ſinne before the Lord, &amp; before men judging according to the rules of Gods word, which is the touchſtone of al truth: &amp; according wherevnto all our judgments muſt be ſquared, as by a canon &amp; rule of direction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Now a company of wicked men having ſome few Saynts known only to the Lord among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for being mingled with the wicked in Spiritual communion, they cannot be judged Saynts by the rule of Gods word to man particularly &amp; certaynly) as your aſſemblies of England are, cannot be al caled Saynts in any colour of truth: For then al the men of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland are Saynts, ſeing they al are joyned together into one Eccleſiaſtical body, which I ſuppoſe you cannot nor dare not ſay the Scripture ever intended ſo to give them deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: but you muſt vnderſtand that we acknowledg the viſible Church a mixt com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany in the Lords account &amp; eſtimation, &amp; in our general comprehenſion: For ſo wee learne that the viſible Church conſiſteth of wheate &amp; tares, Mat. 13. The Lord he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Church hath Hypocrites in it, &amp; we are informed ſo by the ſcriptures: ther were but twelve Apoſtles, &amp; one of them was a Devil: but eight perſons in the Arck, &amp; curſed Cham was one: but foure perſons in the beginning &amp; Runagate Kain was one: but ſtil we deny that open wicked impenitent perſons can be called Saynts, bicauſe of the communion &amp; preſence of ſome elect ones who are only known vnto the Lord, being of one eccleſiaſtical body with the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Neither can a wicked company be called Holy or Saints truly in reſpect of the viſible ſignes of Gods favour or preſence, For then the Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, Arrians, &amp; among them &amp; Exod. 3.5. the ground was caled Holy: &amp; Mat. 4.5. Ieruſalem is caled the Holy cittie, typicaly not truly, as I have expounded vnto you before in reſpect whereof alſo the Lord is ſaid to ſee no iniquity in Iacob, nor tranſgreſſion in Iſrael, Nomb. 23.21-ſeing that people at that preſent was typically Holy &amp; ſo typically without imputation of iniquity in reſpect of their typical communion.</p>
                  <p>And for the Parable, Mat. 13. of the wheate &amp; tares <hi>I</hi> doe conſtantly avouch that though you &amp; al divines with you doe expound it of open wicked impenitent perſons, &amp; Saints, ſuppoſed in communion together, yet the parable is wreſted from the true purpoſe of Chriſt, who doth not intend to teach that, for then he should teach contrary to himſelf, who by the parable of the Leaven declareth that one wicked perſone defileth the whole lump, Mat. 13.33 compared with 1.

               <p n="5">5. That the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to the whole multitude, &amp; not to the principal members therof: Theſe are your wordes.</p>
               <p>I hold &amp; maintayne out of the word that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of faithful people Seperated from al vncleanenes &amp; joyned together by a covenant of the L. are a true Church: yea though they be but two or three: So Adam &amp; Hevah were a Church: ſo Lot, his wife, &amp; his daughters were a Church: So Noah &amp; his family in the Ark were a church: So the twelve men at Epheſus were a Church, Act. 19.7. So in Q. Maries dayes the Martyrs ſeperated were a church, if but two or thre of them lived together: That this is a truth, <hi>I</hi> prove vnto you thus.</p>
               <p>2. Cor. 6.16-18. with whome God maketh his covenant to be ther God, &amp; whome he receaveth to be his people, they are a Temple, that is a Church vnto him, vſ. 16.</p>
               <p>But two or three faithful people comming forth from the vnbeleevers, &amp; being Seperated, &amp; touching no vneleane thing, are Gods people, &amp; God with them maketh his covenant, &amp; they are his ſonnes &amp; daughters, &amp; he is their Father, vſ. 16.17.18.</p>
               <p>Therfor two or three faithful people are the Temple and Church of God.</p>
               <p>The Premiſſes are evidently delivered in the Scripture: therfor the concluſion folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neceſſarily.</p>
               <p>Mat. 18.20. wher two or thre are gathered together into my name, ther am <hi>I</hi> in the mids of them.</p>
               <p>In the mids of whomſoever Chriſt doth dwel &amp; walk, they are a true Church of Chriſt: Even his Temple, Tabernacle, &amp; habitation: as theſe Scriptures teach being compared together, Mat. 28.20. 2. Cor. 6.16. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 26.11.12.</p>
               <p>But among two or three gathered together by love, &amp; into the name of Chriſt by faith, Chriſt is preſent to dwel &amp; walk, Mat. 18.20. 2. Cor. 6.16. compared together.</p>
               <p>Therefor two or three faithful people are the Temple &amp; Church of God. I could alledg other Scriptures: but two or three witneſſes are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>Remember for this point that the covenant made with Adam, Abaham, Iſaac, Iacob, &amp; al the faithful, is made with any faithful people in the world, as if two or three faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people should aiſe vp in the dominions of the Turk, or Pope, or Iewes, or Pagans, &amp; joyne together to walk in the faith, the Lord maketh his covenant with them, he is their God, they are his people, they are his Temple, he walketh ther, he is their Father, they are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3153:24"/>his ſonnes &amp; daughters, Chriſt is their King, they are his Kingdome, even a Kingdome of Preiſts, &amp;c: &amp; therfor wherſoever in the Scripture the covenant is made with any, it is to be vnderſtood as made with Abrahams childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the faith, &amp; therfor with two or three faithful people any were in the world.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed as the ground of our whole cauſe, &amp; we having departed from al the profane of the Land, &amp; having ſeperated &amp; touching no vncleane thing, 2. cor. 6, 17 We are Gods people, his temple, his Church: he dwelleth &amp; walketh among vs, &amp; he hath given to vs, &amp; made with vs his covenant, Heb. 8.10. &amp; although we were but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wee being now the Church of God, wee have the powre of the L.

               <p>Marc. 13.34. Chriſt aſcending vp into Heaven (for that is his going into a farre country as may be perceaved by Luk. 19.12. with Mat. 28.18. &amp; Eph. 4.8.) gave authority to his ſervants leaving his howſe that is his Church according to his bodily preſence: now what authority is this that Chriſt gave vnto his ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? that is evident by other places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, 1. Cor. 5. the powre of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt which the Corinths had that is the powre of admonition &amp; excommunication, the powre of binding &amp; loſing, a powre to adminiſter Chriſts Kingdome, &amp; al the ordinances therof.</p>
               <p>Mat. 16.19. The powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to Peter.</p>
               <p>Ioh. 20.23. The powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to al the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Marc. 13.34. The powre of Chriſt it given to his Servants.</p>
               <p>1. Cor. 5.4 The powre of Chriſt is in the hands of the Corinths.</p>
               <p>Now let vs make collections &amp; gather inſtructions out of theſe places, &amp; the truth wil moſt evidently appeare.</p>
               <p>The Pope ſaith out of the 16. of Mathew, that the powre of binding &amp; loſing is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Peter &amp; his ſucceſſors the popes of Rome &amp; that al the Bbs. &amp; Preiſts in the world, &amp; the whole Church vniverſal receaveth binding &amp; loſing from him.</p>
               <p>Nay ſay the English Prelates out of the 20. of Iohn Chriſt gave the powre of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; loſing to al the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſors the Lord Bbs. of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; that al the Preiſts, &amp; people in the Land, receave binding &amp; loſing from them in their ſeverall dioceſes.</p>
               <p>Nay ſay the Presbyterians of England out of Mat. 18.17. The powre of binding &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is given to the Edership, &amp; the poeple they are bound or loſed by the Presbytery: For by the Church they vnderſtand the Presbytery.</p>
               <p>Nay ſay we, the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to the body of the Church, even to two or thre faithful people joyned together in covenant, &amp; this we prove evidently in this manner.</p>
               <p>Vnto whome the covenant is given, vnto them the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given.</p>
               <p>The covenant is given to the body of the Church, that is to two or three faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3153:24"/>ones: For God is their God, &amp; they are his people.</p>
               <p>Therfor the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to them.</p>
               <p>Againe. Vnto whom Chriſt is given for King, vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the powre of Chriſt the King is given, as being his deputies &amp; lieftenants.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is given for King vnto the body of the Church, even to two or three faithful people, who are his Kingdome, &amp; howſe, &amp; cittie.</p>
               <p>Therfor vnto them is given his powre, that is his powre to bind &amp; loſe.</p>
               <p>Finally. Vnto whome the covenant &amp; Chriſt is given, vnto them al the promiſes are given, for al the promiſes are conteyned in the covenant, &amp; in Chriſt, as theſe places prove, 2. Cor. 1.20. Pſal. 133.3. Act. 2.39. Gal. 3.14.15.16. &amp; the powre of binding &amp; loſing is one of the promiſes, &amp; is a part &amp; parcel of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Mat. 16.19. Ioh. 20.23. Mat. 18.15-20.</p>
               <p>But the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; Chriſt &amp; al the promiſes, are give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the body of the church even to two or three faithful ones.</p>
               <p>Therfor the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to them alſo.</p>
               <p>But ther are certayne objections which muſt be anſwered in nomber three.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. One is that Chriſt ſpeaketh only to Peter &amp; to his Apoſtles, &amp; giveth the powre only to them therfor, Mat. 16.19. Iohn. 20.23. Mat. 18.17.</p>
               <p>For anſwer thus much.</p>
               <p>The place Mat. 16. although it be directed to Peter perſonally, yet it is intended vnto all the Diſciples of Chriſt: For vnto them is the powre given, that have the ſaith and made the confeſſion ther mentioned: But the faith &amp; confeſſion of faith is of al the Diſciples, &amp; ſpoken by Peter in behalf of them al: &amp; therfor the powre is by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe given to al,</p>
               <p>The place Ioh. 20.23. importeth plainly that Mary Magdalene, &amp; divers other of the Diſciples were preſent when Chriſt ſpake vnto them for they were aſſembled together in a howſe, the dore being shut, &amp; it was the L. day: &amp; not the Apoſtles only, but the reſt of the Diſciples were aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled in al likely-hood for the Sanctification of the L. day: yea fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Thomas was abſent, &amp; ſo the promiſe of binding &amp; loſing could not be made to him at that preſent, &amp; afterward it was not made to him, &amp; ſo by conſequent that one of the Ap. had not the powre give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by ther reaſon which plead it to be given to the Apoſt. only. The place Mat. 18.17. doth not prove that this powre was given to the Presbyterie, for that place importeth that it was given to the Church, now the Eldership is not the Church, but a part of the Church, &amp; it muſt be proved that the word Church doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie the Eldership (or els this place wil help nothing), as I am ſure cannot be showed out of the word: beſides the circumſtances of the place teach that Chriſt inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the powre of binding &amp; loſing to be given to every brother, for ſo he ſaith, if thy brother ſin: &amp; lett him be vnto the: &amp; take two or three witneſſes: &amp; where two or three, &amp;c. <hi>I</hi> am in the midſt of them.</p>
               <p>Finally, It cannot be denyed but admonition aperteyneth to every brother, &amp; why should not excommunication: For their is powre to bind &amp; loſe in two or thre witneſſes toward a brother, &amp; why not powre to bind &amp; loſe in the body of the Church, if the whole Church be but two or three: or ſome ſmal nomber.</p>
               <p>Now for the vtter over throwing of this conceipt of the powre given to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3153:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>only, conſider that the twelve were not yet Apoſtles, only they were nominated to be Apoſtles: they were inveſted in their office at the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt on the day fo Pentecoſt: which I prove vnto you evidently. Eph. 4.8.11, when Chriſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he gave gifts vnto men, viz: the gifts of Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors &amp; Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: For Chriſt receaved his Kingdom when he aſcended. Luk. 19.12. For Chriſt obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Kingdome by his death, &amp; he receaved his Kingdome, when he went into that fane country: &amp; Chriſt by his ſufferings entred into his glory: So that Chriſts Kingdome in regard of the outward regiment &amp; ordinances thereof beganne at the day of Pentecoſt, when the Apoſtles were endued with powre from on high Luk. 24.49. Act, 1.8. &amp; it shal end at the day of judgment, 1. Cor. 15.24.25. Seing therfor that they were not yet Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, but only Diſciples, the powre given to them was given to them as Diſciples, not as Apoſtles: &amp; therfor all Chriſts Diſciples may juſtly in al ages challendg that powre of bin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding &amp; loſing: For a concluſion therfor in a word, the commaundement of binding and loſing is given to every brother, go the promiſe &amp; powre of binding &amp; loſing is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them alſo: as the forſaid places do evince. &amp; as the charter of a corporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King &amp; al the offices have powre from the corporation, ſo the Church hath powre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, &amp; the Eldership from the church &amp; as the body hath powre from the head, &amp; the parts of the body have their powre from the body: So the church which is Chriſts body; hath powre from Chriſt, &amp; the Eldership a part of the body hath powre from the body.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. A ſecond objection is this that if the powre of binding &amp; loſing be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the body of the Church, then powre of preaching &amp; adminiſtring the ſeales of the covenant: truth: we confeſſe it: &amp; the church being a corporation committeth powre to adminiſter to ſuch officers as Chriſt hath apointed to his church, viz: to the Elders or Bishops: ſtil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving powre to correct her officers by the ſame powre of binding &amp; loſing in admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; excommunication, the benefit wherof doth as wel perteyne to the Elders as other of the brethren, except it be ſaid the Elders are to be exempted from cenſures, &amp; ſo to want thoſe meanes of Salvation which the brethren have, which is a pitiful condition, &amp; alamentable priviledg.</p>
               <p>Ob. 3. A third ebjection is that the benefit of binding &amp; loſing, of the word &amp; ſeales of the covenant is given to the church, &amp; al the members, but not the powre of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherto thus much may be anſwered, viz: that the Church, viz: two or thre faithful ones have as is ſaid the covenant, Chriſt, the promiſes not only in vſe, but in title &amp; poſſeſſion: &amp; the faithful have as good powre &amp; title or intereſt to the covenant, Chriſt, &amp; the promiſes, as a freholder hath to his lands &amp; poſſeſſions. Eſa 9.6. Vnto vs a ſonne is given: the chruch is the ſpouſe of Chriſt, &amp; ſo hath powre to Chriſt the covenant &amp; promiſes: the Church is the body of Chriſt, the body hath a real poſſeſſion, title, &amp; powre to the head &amp; all the helps therof: For the faithful are flesh &amp; bones of Chriſt, Eph. 5.30. theſe things are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to them that wil vnderſtand: &amp; if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant.</p>
               <p>But it may be Mr. Bern. you wil ſay that powre to bind &amp; loſe are no properties of the Church, but only priviledges: For shame ſay not ſo: Surely this plea argueth that either you got litle Logick in the vniverſity, or that you have forgot it, or if you reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber it you either careleſly neglect it, or wilfully pervert the vſe of it to ſeduce your followers: <hi>I</hi> pray you tel me in good ſooth what difference is there betwixt a priviledg &amp; a propertie: Is not a priviledge according to the notation of the word privata lex: a private law wherin
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3153:25"/>one perſon or ſtate is intereſſed. The King hath certaine previledges or prerogatives as to pardon condemned perſons, to diſpence with his law, a negative voice in parliament &amp;c. I would faigne know of you, whither theſe be not properties, ſuch as the Kings &amp; Queenes of the nation only have title to &amp; no other: but conſider wel with your ſelf what relation ther is betwixt a priviledg &amp; the perſon that is interreſſed in the priviledg: Is it not the relation of the ſubject &amp; the adjunct? A priviledg therfor is an adjunct to the priviledged perſon: Now al adjuncts are either proper or common adjuncts: but a priviledge is not a common adjunct, as I am ſure you wil confeſſe, or els you want reaſon: therfor it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per adjunct: It it be a proper adjunct it is a propertie, &amp; ſo your diſtinction is ſenſeleſſe &amp; vnſcholler like you may aswel ſay that pepper is hot in working &amp; cold in operation, as to ſay that the true Church may be without her priviledges, but not without her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: Therfor I doe heer before the L. attach you as a deceaver of the people in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thus contrary to al learning &amp; true vſe of reaſon, that the powre of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt given to the church, one part whereof conſiſteth in binding &amp; loſing is only a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg &amp; not a propertie of the true Church: &amp; that the true Church may want it: It is as impoſſible for the true Church to want Chriſts powre, as for a man to want reaſon: Mr. Ber. anſwer now or els yeeld to the truth you cannot for shame denie the one of them.</p>

I wil endevour according to my poore hability to diſcover what I have conceaved, and doe vndoubtedly beleeve from the Scriptures, and doe make the beginning of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition after this manner which I deſire the gentle reader to weigh &amp; conſider of with his beſt attention. Chriſts viſible church which is his Kingdom, hath in it a ſpiritual powre and juriſdiction by the confeſſion of al that profeſſe Ieſus Chriſt: which powre is of two ſortes: 1. The powre of Chriſt himſelf, who is the Lord &amp; King of his Church. Mat. 28.18 and he is the Fountaine of powre, being the head of the Church which is his body, Eph. 1.22.23. For as the head is the Fountaine of life, ſenſe, motion, &amp; powre to the whole body, &amp; as the Mr. of the howſe is the original of al oeconomical powre: So is Chriſt the original of al ſpiritual life, ſenſe, motion, &amp; powre to the Church which is his body &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: This is evident: &amp; in regard of this powre which is inherent in Chriſt, the church which is Chriſts Kingdome may truly be termed a Monarchie, Mat. 23.8-11. Epheſ. 4.5, Iam. 4.12. This powre which Chriſt hath in himſelf cannot paſſe from himſelf to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For as his preiſthood is eternal, &amp; not paſſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to another, Heb. 7.24. ſo may it as truly be ſaid of his other offices, &amp; particularly of his Kingdome &amp; Monarchicall powre: Nevertheleſſe 2. The Lord Ieſus hath ordeyned &amp; appointed a certayne order to be obſerved in his abſence in the true viſible Church, &amp; hath delegated a certaine powre &amp; authority to his Servants &amp; ſubjects for the preferving of that order, &amp; for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thoſe ordinances: This delegated powre &amp; authority is mentioned Marc. 13.34 1. Cor. 5.4. This delegated powre is avouched by the Papiſts to be in the Pope, by the English Prelates to be in the Lord Bbs. &amp; Archdeacons: By the Presbyterians to be in the Eldership: by the brethren of the Seperation to be in the body of the Church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and fundamentally: For if the Pope, Prelates, Presbytery, or Body of the Church do ſay that the powre which is in Chriſt Ieſus is in them, they doe blaſpheme moſt fear fully robbing Chriſt of his honour &amp; Regal powre, &amp; make themſelves even Chriſt him ſelf: The Pope therfor is not Antichriſt for that he vſurpeth that regal powre which is proper to Chriſt: neither are the Bbs. of England Antichriſt for vſurping that proper kingly powre which is only in Chriſt: nor the Presbytery Antichriſtian for challendging the powre Monarchical of Chriſt: but they are al Antichriſtian for vſurping the delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted powre of Chriſt which he hath originally given to the body of his Church which is his myſticall body.</p>
                  <p>This delegated &amp; Miniſterial powre which the Pope, Bbs. &amp; Presbytery challendg,

The presbyterians ſay that Chriſt hath given this miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial powre to the presbytery, or Eldership, &amp; they conveigh it ſucceſſively to the elders ſucceding to the worldes end in the Church: Al theſe three opinions are equally Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, for they al of them eſtablish ſucceſſion which is Iewish, &amp; ſo Antichriſtian. For in the old Teſtament the preiſthood was conveighed by ſucceſſiuon Heer therfor I will prove vnto you by vndeniable arguments, that the powre of Chriſt is not given ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the pope, Bbs, or presbytery, but primarily it is given to the body of the Church.</p>

                     <p>To whome preaching &amp; baptizing is committed, to them the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given.</p>
                     <p>Powre to preach &amp; baptize is given to the Diſciples of Chriſt, or to the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to the body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: powre to bind &amp; loſe, that is Chriſts miniſterial powre is given to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples, or brethren, or the body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Major of this argument is true by proportion of parity: For by one &amp; the ſame powre, doth the Church, preach, pray, baptize, adminiſter the L. Supper, excommunicate, abſolve, &amp;c. viz: by the miniſterial powre of Chriſt: &amp; therfor if the body of the church being more or fewer have powre to preach &amp; baptize, they have powre to bind &amp; loſe: The rather conſidering that preaching the Goſpel is a mayne part of binding &amp; loſing of men to &amp; from their ſinnes, &amp; a principal part of the powre of the keyes in shutting &amp; opening heaven gates to the impenitent or penitent ſinners.</p>
                     <p>The Minor of this argument may be confirmed by this reaſon.</p>
                     <p>To whome Chriſt promiſeth his preſence to the worldes end: To them he giveth powre to preach &amp; baptize.</p>
                     <p>But to his Diſcipls Chriſt promiſeth his preſence to the worldes end, even to two or three gathered together into his name: Mat. 18.20. &amp; 28.20. yea to any Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated people. 2. Cor. 6.16-18.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: To his Diſciples, to two or thre gathered toge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ther into his name, doth he give powre to preach &amp; baptize.</p>

                     <head>The fourth argument from Marc. 13.33-37.</head>
                     <p>From this place of Scripture I frame an Argument thus:</p>
                     <p>Chriſts Servants have Chriſts authority:</p>
                     <p>Chriſts viſible Church, or two or three faithful people are Chriſts Servants.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: Chriſts viſible Church hath Chriſts authority.</p>
                     <p>Heer by the way may be noted that in this place Marc. 13.34. Chriſt giveth authority to his Servants: But Mat. 28.18. Chriſt receaveth authority or powre from his Father, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the powre in heaven &amp; earth, wherby wee may collect that which was before affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Chriſts powre is donble, 1. that powre Monarchicall which is inherent in his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3153:32"/>owne perſon, &amp; is incommunicable to any creature, 2. That powre Miniſteriall which he delegateth to his Servants, to his Diſciples, to two or three faithfull people whereſoever.</p>
                     <p>But concerning the argument if it be objected that Chriſts Servants are the Apoſtles, &amp; their Succeſſors: I deny it: For ther is a diſtinction made between the Servants &amp; the Porter: Now the authority is given generally to the Servants of the howſe, &amp; watching is ſpecially enjoyned to the Porter: &amp; if it be any thing that the Apoſtles &amp; their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iceſſors have, it is watching by way of office, for ſo the porter is to wach: &amp; yet that duty alſo is particularly applyed &amp; injoyned to every one vſ. 37.</p>

                     <head>The fifth Argument, from Ioh. 20.18-24. &amp; Luk. 24.35-53.</head>
                     <p>From theſe places of Scripture compared together I collect this argument.</p>
                     <p>If Chriſts Miniſterial powre of binding &amp; loſing be given to Marie Magdalene, &amp; Cleopas, joyntly with the reſt of the Diſciples of Chriſt: Then it is given to the body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But powre of binding &amp; loſing, remitting &amp; retayning ſinnes is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene, &amp; Cleopas, joyntly with the reſt of Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>Therfor Chriſts miniſterial powre of binding &amp; loſing, or remitting &amp; retayning ſinnes is given to the body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Minor of this argument may eaſily be proved by comparing the two former pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of Seripture together: For in Luke Cleopas &amp; the other Diſciple brought tidings off Chriſts Reſurection to the eleven, &amp; others that were with them: Luke. 24.33.34.36. VVhence it is evident that Cleopas, the other Diſciple, the eleven, &amp; others were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This day was the firſt day of the weeke, vſ. 23.33.36. Even that very day wherein Chriſt aroſe: Now vppon this day Chriſt ſpake thoſe wordes, &amp; gave the powre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting &amp; retayning ſinnes vnto al the Diſciples, not only to the eleven, but to Cleopas, Marie Magdaſene, &amp; others aſſembled together that night when Chriſt appeared to them al together jointly in the howſe, Joh. 20.23.</p>

                     <p>From theſe places of Scripture compared together I frame this argument.</p>
                     <p>Vnto whom the promiſes, the covenant, the bleſſing is given, vnto them the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial powre of Chriſt, viz: the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given.</p>
                     <p>But the promiſes, the covenant, the bleſſing is given to the poſterity of Abraham, according to the faith, that is to al the faithful, who are indeed the true children of Abraham, Ioh. 8.39.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: Chriſts miniſteriall powre, viz: The powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to the faithful: That is to two or three faithfull people which are a true body vnto Chriſt,</p>
                     <p>The conſequent of this argument only is doubtful: For cleering whereof wee muſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3153:33"/>know that the keies of the Kingdom of heaven is a promiſe which Chriſt maketh to his Church, Mat. 16.19. wherin the cheef part of the comfort of the Church conſiſteth: it is alſo one principal part of the covenant or new Teſtament which Chriſt hath eſtablished by his blood &amp; purchaſed for his Church, which is ſealed vp vnto the Church in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring &amp; pertaking in the ſeales of the covenant: it is alſo a ſpecial part of the bleſſing by the ſame reaſon: For the bleſſing is this: That they that bleſſe the Church &amp; faithful shal be bleſſed: &amp; they that curſe the Church shalbe curſed: Geneſ. 12.3. alſo remiſſion of ſins is a part of the bleſſing, Rom. 4.7.8. &amp; binding &amp; loſing is remitting or tetayning ſinne, bleſſing &amp; curſing, as is moſt evident. So that ſeing that powre of binding &amp; loſing, remit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting &amp; retayning ſinne, is a part of the promiſe, covenant, &amp; bleſſing, therfor the faithfull having the covenant, promiſe, &amp; bleſſing given to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they have alſo therwith the powre of binding &amp; loſing, that is Chriſts miniſterial powre, &amp; therfor the conſequent of this ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument is fume &amp; the vndoubted truth of God.</p>

                     <p>From theſe Scriptures compared together I draw this argument.</p>
                     <p>The wife hath powre immediately from her husband, &amp; the body hath powre im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the head.</p>

                     <p>Ergo the viſible Church or a communion of faithful ones have Chriſts miniſteriall powre immediately from him.</p>
                     <p>Againe: As the body hath life, ſenſe, motion &amp; powre from the head, the hands &amp; feet have powre from the body: So the Church hath powre from Chriſt the head, the members of the Church as the Elders &amp; Deacons have powre from the Church.</p>
                     <p>But it is true in nature, that the body hath life, ſence, motion &amp; powre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head: &amp; al the members have powre from the body.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: the Church hath powre from Chriſt the head: the members of the Church, viz: the Elders &amp; Deacons have powre from the Church.</p>
                     <p>By al which arguments put together it appeareth moſt evidently that Chriſts miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3153:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>powre of binding &amp; loſing is given to the body of eyery true viſible Church, and that all the Officers of the Church have their powre and authority to adminiſter derived vnto them from Chriſt through the body of the Church where they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter.</p>
                     <p>And thus have I proved evidently as I take it both that Chriſts miniſterial powre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not by ſucceſſive ordination by the hands of the miniſtery: &amp; that it is immediately given to the body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>And heer for your further informacion Mr. Bern. I wish you to take notice that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is a typical ordinance of the Old Teſtament, &amp; therfor abolished by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming: For the Apoſtle wisheth vs to take heed of Iewish Fables &amp; Genealogies. 1. Tim. 1 4. Tit. 1.14. bicauſe theſe genealogies were of neceſſity for the carnal ordinances of the old Teſtament, but the Spiritual genealogie &amp; ſucceſſion is for the new teſtament: In the old Teſtament they had carnal parents a carnal ſeed, carnal children, carnal cſrcumciſion, carnal commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, a carnal temple, a carnal cittie, a carnal preiſthood, a carnal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: in the new Teſtament we have ſpiritual parents, a ſpiritual ſeed which is the word, ſpiritual children, viz: the faithful, circumciſion made without hands, ſpiritual commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, a ſpiritual temple, an heavenly cittie, ſpiritual Preiſts &amp; Kings, &amp; a ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom &amp; preiſthood: Therfor ſucceſſion in the old Teſtament was carnal by genealogie: if you therfor wil ſet vp a carnal ſucceſſion in the new Teſtament by ordination for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, you muſt do it alſo, 1. For the Church, &amp; ſo fetch it from Rome, 2. For the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, &amp; ſo fetch it from Rome, 3. For the L. Supper, &amp; ſo fetch it from Rome, 4. For the Faith, &amp; ſo fetch it from Rome, 5. For excommunication, &amp; ſo fetch it from Rome: &amp; ſo forth of the reſt, &amp; this is to tie all Churches to the vnity &amp; ſucceſſion of the chayre of Rome, as in the old Teſtament al were tyed to the vnity &amp; ſucceſſion of the temple at Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruſalem: Herin therfor you ſee how you vanish away in your jmaginations by ſetting vp ſucceſſion, approving your ſelf before you be aware a Iew, a Papiſt, an Antichriſtian: this shal ſuffice for the matter of ordination or ſucceſſion, wherby it apeareth to be a Iewish Popish, &amp; Antichriſtian deviſe.</p>
                     <p>In the next place let vs heer your nine reaſons Mr, Bernard which you bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this our faith, and moſt evident truth of God: wher firſt in generall note that wee doe not deny, but that the powre of the Church is for order ſake committed into ſome particular perſons hands, who in the Churches name, &amp; for the Churches good, &amp; in the Churches preſence are to handle al Church matters, &amp; therfor whereas your 9-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are brought againſt popularity as you cal it, you are to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that Chriſts church in ſeveral reſpects is a Monarchie, an Ariſtocraty, a Democratie. In reſpect of Chriſt the King it is a Monarchy, of the Eldership an Ariſtocratie, of the brethren joyntly a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie or Popular government: For Chriſt the King he ruleth by his owne lawes &amp; Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers: The body of the Church, the ſpowſe of Chriſt ruleth as the wiſe vnder the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, according to the wil &amp; appointment of her husband: The Elders rule as the ſtewards of Chriſt the King, &amp; of the church which is the wiſe or ſpowſe of the King: Now as it is vnreaſonable to appoint the ſteward or Servant of the King either over the King himſelf, or over the Queen who is the Kings wife: So is it Antichriſtian to place the Elders as Rulers over the whole body of the Church, although every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and cauſe is ſubject to be ordered by that authority which the Church joyntly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3153:34"/>from Chriſt, and delegateth to them: wee ſay therefore that the body of the Church hath all powre immediately from Chriſt: and the Elders have al their powre from the body of the Church, which powre of the Eldership is not exercized, nor can not be vſed over or againſt the whole body of the Church, for that is an Antichriſtian v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation: but only it is exerciſed over and againſt particular perſons and diſorders ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Church, the Eldership herein dealing for the body in the publique workes thereof: breefly therefore to anſwer in generall to all your nine reaſons, vſed againſt popularity, wee diſpute not whither the Elders muſt rule or not, but wee diſpute who have the negative voice in their hands, or who have the determining powre in them: or who give the definitive ſentence in al matters: VVee ſay that the definitive ſentence the determining powre, the negative voice is in the body of the church, not in the Elders: yet we ſay the Elders are to lead &amp; governe al perſons &amp; cauſes of the Church, but to lead &amp; governe contrary to the definition &amp; voice of the body that we deny, &amp; that we ſay is Antichriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Your firſt reaſon Mr. Bernard is that popularity is contrary to Gods order vnder the law and before the law, vnder the law the powre of Governing was in the Levites: befor the law it was in the firſt borne, &amp; this governing powre was not receaved from the people vnder the law, but from the Lord by Moſes: but the people only approved the Lords appointment.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: The firſt borne and ſo by conſequent the Levites did type two things, 1. That Priviledg and prerogative which Chriſt Ieſus hath, who is the firſt borne having the preeminence in all things, Coloſ. 1.18.1, Cor. 15.20. Revel. 1.5. For Chriſt is the firſt &amp; moſt noble in the Church, even the head, &amp; Fountayne of al heavenly grace &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: 2. The firſt borne and ſo by conſequent the Levites did shadow out the church. Exod. 4.22.23. who is the firſt borne of al the men of the earth moſt deere and pretious to the Lord: So that this reaſon of yours may thus be retorted vppon your ſelſf.</p>
                     <p>If the firſt borne before the law, &amp; the Levites for the firſt borne vnder the law, had the preheminence: then Chriſt, &amp; the viſible Church which were shadowed out by the firſt borne, &amp; by the Levites, have the preminence &amp; powre in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>

                     <p>Ergo: Chriſt &amp; the viſible church from Chriſt, shadowed out by the firſt borne &amp; the Levites, have the powre &amp; preheminence in the new Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Remember for this particular that the firſt borne, the firſt Fruites, the Preiſts, Levites, Rings &amp; Princes of Iudah did al type forth vnto vs in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the viſible church &amp; the Saints next vnder Chriſt who is the head to the body of the Church as theſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do manifeſtly declare, 1.

                     <p>The ſecond of your nine reaſons againſt popularity is that it is without warrant in the Apoſtles tyme: The Apoſtles alwayes begune, continued and compoſed church matters, the body of the congregation were only made acquaynted with matters, aliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty granted them to choſe officers, but they did never make any themſelves: nor atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted any thing of themſelves.</p>

                     <p> This argument Mr. Bern. is partly vntrue, partly againſt your ſelf: Vntrue it is thus far forth that you ſay the body of the congregation never attempted any thing without El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: For I demaund of you: what did the 120. perſons in the firſt of the acts, did they not chuſe an Apoſtle into office &amp; ordeyne him? but they had no Elders as yet: for the holy Ghoſt was not come downe vppon them, &amp; ſo the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eph. 4.8.11? did not the Churches of Lyſtra, Iconium, &amp; Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia think you worship God, admonish &amp; excommunicate, during the tyme of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles abſence from them, when as yet they had no Elders, Act. 14 21-23? did not the Churches in Creta think you worship God, &amp; governe in the abſence of the Apoſtles &amp; Titus when as yet Elders were not appointed, Tit. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. you cannot deny that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were eſtablished before they had officers: if you do the Apoſtle ſaith that they that are to be choſen Elders, muſt not be newly planted into the faith, 1. Tim. 3.6. &amp; ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſequent from the tyme of eſtablishing Churches til Election of officers, ther muſt needes be a ſpace of tyme for tryal of mens gifts &amp; converſation &amp; conſtancy in the faith du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which tyme the Apoſtles being abſent from the Churches, I make no doubt, but they did worship God, &amp; performe the other parts of their Spiritual communion: it they did ſo, then I ſay, look how many Churches were eſtablished by the Apoſtles: So many examples ther are of the congregation attempting every thing almoſt, without Elders: &amp; ſo the Second reaſon of yours conteyneth ſo many vntruths as ther were Churches planted by the Apoſtles in the Acts, who did not the firſt day of their planting inſtitute their Elderships, but ſome certayne competent ſpace of tyme afterward, wherin ther might be ſufficient tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; knowledg of mens gifts &amp; qualifications fit for office: &amp; this may ſuffice for your vntruths.</p>
                     <p>Now further your reaſon is againſt your ſelf in this particular wherein you yeeld the cauſe, that the body of the congregation had a liberty to choſe their officers: whence I reaſon thus againſt you.</p>
                     <p>They that have liberty to choſe their owne officers, &amp; to worship God publiquely before they have officers: they have al the reſt of Chriſts powre miniſterial befor they have officers.</p>
                     <p>But the body of every congregation hath powre to worship God publiquely (as you ſee) &amp; have liberty to choſe their owne officers (as you confeſſe) &amp; yet want Elders.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: the body of every congregation hath al the reſt of Chriſts miniſterial powre before they have officers.</p>
                     <p>I ſay the body of the Church hath powre: which powre commeth after into act &amp; execution when her officers are choſen, viz: The powre of baptizing &amp; adminiſtring the Lords Supper: &amp; yet it may alſo be queſtioned whither the Church may not as well adminiſter the Seales of the covenant before they have Officers, as Pray, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, Elect Officers and the reſt, ſeing that to put the Seales to the covenant is not a greater work then publishing the covenant, or Election of officers, or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
                     <p>The third of your 9. reaſons againſt popularity is that it is againſt Chriſts commiſſion granted to the Apoſtles &amp; their Succeſſors, as Timothie, Titus, &amp; the cheef miniſters of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3153:35"/>the Goſpel: &amp; that therfor the place 1. Cor. 5.4. muſt be expounded of the Elders as you ſay the Apoſtle sheweth, 1. Cor. 2.6.</p>

                     <p>A ſecond vntruth is this, that you ſay the Apoſtles committed that commiſſion given them by Chriſt not to the body of the Church, but to Timothie, Titus, &amp; ther ſucceſſors as appeareth 1. Tim. 6.13.14. as you ſay: wherto I anſwer that the Apoſtles leave the powre which they receaved from Chriſt joyntly with the reſt of the Diſciples, in the hands of the Church not of Timothie &amp; Titus only, &amp; that chardg which Paul gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to Timothie reſpecteth the whole Epiſtle and all the contents thereof which aperteyne to all ſorts of perſons in the Church aswell as to Timothie, as may be ſeen in the whole ſecond Chapter: &amp; how prove you that Timothy an Evangeliſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Paull an Apoſtle? Or that the Elders of Epheſus ſucceded Timothie an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt?</p>
                     <p>A third vntruth is this, that you ſay the place 1. Cor. 5.4.13. muſt be vnderſtood of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as you ſay may appeare, 1. Cor. 2.6. wherto I anſwer that this is a prety trick, but it wil not ſerve your turne, to turne away the truth &amp; evidence to this place: For firſt the Epiſtle is written to the whole body of the Church, al the circumſtances of the Chap. 5. teach that the whole body was leavened, &amp; that their rejoycing was not good, &amp; that they ought not to be mingled with the brethren that were fornicators, &amp; that they ought not to eate the L. Supper with ſuch perſons: that they have powre to judg them that are within, &amp; that they muſt caſt out from among them that inceſtuous perſon: &amp; whereas you would needes by one phraſe (viz: the rebuke of many, 2. Cor. 2.6.) expound this general as ſpoken of many Elders not many brethren, I ſay herein you coyne a falſe expoſition: For doth it follow that bicauſe the rebuke was delivered by many either bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren or Elders who are to leade in al publique actions, therfor the Apoſtle enjoyneth the Elders only to excommunicate? or bicauſe ſome only pronounce the rebuke, &amp; the ſentence of excommunication, therfor they only have powre to decree it? I deſire you would make theſe conſequents hang or depend neceſſarily vppon ther antecedents or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3153:36"/>els you doe but wreſt the Scriptures to your deſtruction: beſides that place, 2. Cor. 2.6. doth not teach who either decreed or pronounced his excommunication, but only who rebuked him for his ſinne which were many (Elders if you will:) For I take it the place is manifeſt that he was not excommunicate, bicauſe he repented vppon the reproof: which the Apoſtle ſaith is ſufficient. And ſometyme in the Scripture many, ſignifieth all: &amp; all ſignifieth many: as theſe places declare, Matt. 3.5. Roman. 5.18.19. Therefore this quirck off yours is but a meer Sophiſticall cavill to put of the truth.</p>
                     <p>The fourth of your 9. reaſons againſt popularity is that the place of Epheſ. 4.11.12. is againſt it, for ther the Apoſtle declareth (ſay you) that gifts for the miniſterie are given to the Miniſters for the Church, not to the Church for the Miniſters: and that therefore the powre of Chriſt is not given to the body of the Church, but only to the Elders: &amp; this you shew by a ſimilie from the parts of the body which do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave their qualityes, facultyes, or gifts from the body, but from God.</p>
                     <p>To this reaſon I anſwer: that you declare your ſelf to be either blind or willfully to shut your eyes againſt the truth &amp; evidence of this place: For it is as cleer as the shining of the Sunne in the Firmament of heaven againſt your expoſition &amp; objection: For I pray you in good ſooth doth this argument follow, viz: Chriſt giveth gifts vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not by the mediation of the body of the Church: therfor Chriſt giveth his miniſterial powre to the officers, &amp; not to the body? yet this is the force of your argument, which may for more evidence be framed thus.</p>
                     <p>If Chriſt give gifts to the officers of the Church, not by the Church, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by &amp; from himſelf: Then Chriſt giveth powre of binding &amp; loſing to the officers of the Church, not by the meanes of the church, but by ſuch meanes as God hath appointed: (that is as I geſſe by Succeſſion.)</p>
                     <p>But you ſay the Antecedent is true by the place of the Eph, 4.</p>
                     <p>And I ſay the conſequent or concluſion followeth not vppon the antecedent: but it is meerly aſyllogiſton.</p>
                     <p>But I will declare the inconſequence more fully: The Lord he giveth gifts to men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinarily or extraordinarily: Extraordinarily he gave gifts to men in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches: Ordinarily he giveth gifts to men by ſtudy, &amp; paynes, &amp; by nature, ſo he gave the gifts of Tongs and Propheſy extraordinarily to the primittive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, be giveth the ſame gifts now ordinarily by meanes of Study and the help of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall witt: How will it follow that bicauſe the Lord gave gifts, therefore he gave his Miniſteriall powre extraordinarily from heaven? VVhy? you confeſſe that powre of binding and loſing was given before Chriſts aſcenſion, but now you would prove by this place Epheſ. 4. that the powre of binding &amp; loſing is given after Chriſts aſſenſion, and that theſe gifts and this powre are given together: is not this to contradict your ſelf? hereby you ſee the weakenes of your reaſon: For you muſt diſtinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the powre of binding and loſing which the Diſciples had committed vnto them before Chriſts aſcenſion: and betwixt the gifts of the day of Pentecoſt.</p>
                     <p>But what are thoſe gifts mentioned in that place of Epheſ. 4.8.11.12. and vnto whome are thoſe gifts given? <hi>I</hi> will declare it vnto you, and ſo your mouth shalbe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p> Theſe gifts which are ſaid to be given to men are thoſe foure ſorts of Officers which the Apoſtle mentioneth vſ. 11. Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors &amp; Teachers, for the two laſt are one office. Theſe officers with their gifts are ſaid to be given to men: who are theſe men vnto whome theſe officers with their gifts are give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? are they not the Church? is not the office of an Elder, Paſtor, or Teacher the L. gift to the Church? This place you ſee therefore is moſt pregnant againſt your opinion: as may appeare thus,</p>
                     <p>That which is given by Chriſt to the Church is in the powre &amp; poſſeſſion of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The officers &amp; offices of the Church are given to the Church.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: the officers &amp; offices of the Church are in the powre &amp; poſſeſſion of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Wherfor I ſay vnto you that the gifts of preaching, adminiſtration of the Sacraments &amp; Governing, are given vnto ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the office &amp; officers indued with theſe gifts are given vnto the Church, who have powre to appoint them to their office, &amp; who do receave both their office &amp; powre to adminiſter in their office from the Church, vnto whome the office &amp; powre of Chriſt is given primarily, being the next Lord therof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt the Monarch.</p>
                     <p>And for your ſimilie of the parts receaving their properties from God: not from the body, it is perverſly applyed: For this is the true vſe and application of the ſimilie: as the head communicateth all the powre &amp; facultie which any part hath from it ſelf, to that part by the body: ſo the head Chriſt communicated his powre to the parts and officers of the Church by the body of the Church: which is Chriſt myſticall: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſome parts of the body have ſome ſpecial properties and qualities which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave not from the head: as the Stomach hath the quality Chilificandi, the liver Sangnificandi, &amp;c. not from the head, but the powre and faculty to vſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty it hath from the head: So ſome members of the Church have ſpecial gifts given them of God, but the powre of vſing thoſe gifts they have from the head Chriſt by the meanes of the body, which is the pipe that from the Fountaine conveigheth all powre Eccleſiaſtical to every officer.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth of your 9. reaſons againſt popularity is that the Scripture doth not lay the Government vppon the people, nor reproveth them for ſuſſering abuſe of Holy things: but vppon the governors civil &amp; Eccleſiaſtical, Ezech. 22.26. 1. Sam. 2, 17. 1. King. 13. Mat 23. Revel. 2.1.8.12.18. &amp; 3.17.14.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer breefly from the Type to the truth concerning matters of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: Seing now the Saynts are all of them made Kings and Preiſts vnto God Revelat. 1.6. Or as the Apoſtle Peter ſaith: Baſileion hierateuma, 1. Pet. 2.9. a Kingly Preiſthood: Therefore now in the New Teſtament the Saynts ſucceede in the place of the Kings and Preiſts of the Old Teſtament in Eccleſiaſticall cauſſes: and as they were burdened with Government and reproof for profanation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: ſo are the Saynts the members of the viſible Church, now burdened with Government Eccleſiaſticall, and reproof for violating the Holy things committed to their cuſtody &amp; fidelity: &amp; therfor I reaſon from your owne confeſſion againſt you thus,</p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:3153:37"/>
                     <p> If Kings &amp; Preiſts in the Old Teſtament were chardged with Government, and blamed for violation of holy things: Then in the New Teſtament the Saints (who are Kings? &amp; Preiſts) are chardged with government, &amp; blamed for violation of Holy things.</p>
                     <p>But Kings &amp; Preiſtts in the old Teſtament were chardged with government, &amp; bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for violation of Holy things.</p>
                     <p>Therfor the Saints in the new Teſtament are chardged with government eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, &amp; blamed for violation of Holy things.</p>
                     <p>And thus you ſee Mr. Ber. how your owne weapon entreth into your owne bowels: &amp; concerning the places of the Revelation that the Aungels of the ſeaven Churches were chardged with government, &amp; blamed for abuſe of the Holy things &amp; not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, I ſay herein you vtter foule vntruths: For Chap. 1. vs. 4-7. the Apoſtle witeth to the 7. Churches of Aſia, &amp; wisheth grace &amp; peace to the Churches &amp; all the members of the Churches: &amp; Chap. 2.11. &amp; at the end of every Epiſtle, the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth application of every Epiſtle to al that have eares, &amp; to the particular Churches: wher for I wonder at your shameleſſe ignorance that should thus falſely belye the Scriptures, &amp; abuſe the reader: To turne the point of this reaſon of yours alſo vppon your ſelf, I ſay thus.</p>
                     <p>If Iohn chardgeth the whole Churches with gouernment &amp; abuſe of holy things (though the meſſage be ſent to the aungel to be published to the whole church) then the whole churches are charged therwith, viz: with government &amp; violatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy things.</p>
                     <p>But Iohn chardgeth the whole Churches with the government &amp; abuſe of Holy things: (though the meſſage be ſent to the Aungel of every Church, to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to the whole Church.)</p>
                     <p>Therfor the whole Churches are chardged with the government &amp; violation of the holy things.</p>
                     <p>Thus much breefly concerning your fifth reaſon: &amp; heer you make a digreſſion to prove vnto vs that Matt. 18.17, Tell the Church muſt be expounded: Tel the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors: For confirmation whereof you bring vs ſeaven reaſons which I will handle in order.</p>
                     <p>Your firſt reaſon to prove that: Tel the Church is Tel the Governors, is this: for that otherwiſe Chriſt could not be vnderſtood, for if he had brought in a ſtrange courſe not heard of before, nor then practiſed, no man could vnderſtand his meaning: Seing therfor before then &amp; after the practiſe was to tel to the Elders or governors: therfor tel to the Church is tel to the Governors or Elders.</p>
                     <p>A las for you Mr. Bern. this is borrowed ſtuffe, &amp; yet ſtark naught: For it is but froth &amp; chaffe: &amp; what is the chaffe to the wheat? Do not you think that the whole Goſpell is a myſtery which was kept ſecreat from the beginning of the world &amp; is not the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of the new Teſtament with all the ordinances thereof, the cheef &amp; principal part of the Goſpel? &amp; therfor, ſeing this ordinance of telling the Church is a part of the Goſpel, it was formerly hidden &amp; myſtical, &amp; now it was revealed plainly by Chriſt: &amp; although happily the Diſciples vnderſtood not Chriſts meaning at that preſent, yet after ward the Holy Ghoſt brought that &amp; many other neceſſary things which they eyther
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3153:37"/>vnderſtood not Chriſts meaning at that preſent, yet afterward the Holy Ghoſt brought that &amp; many other neceſſary things which they either vnderſtood not or forgot, to their knowledg &amp; memory as the Scripture witneſſeth: But further <hi>I</hi> ſay that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was obſcurely ſignified by the Typical King and Preiſts in the Old Teſtament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome the Government was committed, as <hi>I</hi> have already more then once decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you: &amp; further the government was then given to al Chriſts Diſciples by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as I have already proved ſufficiently to your conſcience &amp; the conſcience of all that love the truth in ſincerity.</p>
                     <p>That of the excommunication of the blind man Ioh. 9.22. was a deviſe of the Iewes, for ther is no warrant for it in al the law: &amp; if it were the L. ordinance, it typeth vnto vs thus much that the viſible Church ſucceeding in the place of the typical Kings &amp; preiſts have in their hands the powre of excommunication.</p>
                     <p>And although Cloe made complaint to the Governor yet it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: For Cloe complayneth of an whole Church to an Apoſtle: not of a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Elders of a particular Church: and doe you think that this is a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? That ſeing a particular perſon complayneth to or informeth the Apoſtle of the ſtate of the Church (who had an infallible gift of inſtructing and directing of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) therefore a particular perſon in the third place or degree of admonition muſt tell the Elders, &amp; that therfor thoſe Elders are the Church? The argument is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent.</p>
                     <p>Your ſecond reaſon that tel the Church is tel the Governors is Chriſts chandg of the perſon: From the third to the ſecond: The force of your argument is this.</p>
                     <p>If Chriſt having ſpoken in the third perſon ſaying: Tel the Church: afterward tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his ſpeech to the ſecond perſon ſaying: whatſoever ye bind &amp;c. then tel the Church is tel the Elders.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt chandgeth his ſpeech from the third to the ſecond perſon.</p>
                     <p>Therfor tell the Church is tel the Elders.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Ber. you were not wel adviſed in making this argument: For it overthroweth your expoſition moſt manifeſtly, as thus.</p>
                     <p>If Chriſt calleth his Diſciples the Church, then tel the Church is tel the Diſciples or the body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt calleth al his Diſciples the Church: For this commiſſion of binding and loſing is given to all the Diſciples jointly as is already declared more fully in the former arguments.</p>
                     <p>Therfor tel the Church is tel the body of the Church, al Chriſts Diſciples, &amp; not only the Governors.</p>
                     <p>Therfor this reaſon confirmeth the truth we hold, &amp; not the error which you ſeek to defend by wreſting the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Your third reaſon that tel the Church is tell the Governors is, for that Chriſt ſpeaketh of two or three. That is to ſay (after your expoſition) of two or three Elders or governors &amp; not of the whole body.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer that your argument is without al force of conſequence: For to argue thus is to argue without reaſon or force of argument, viz.</p>

                     <p> Iff Chriſt ſpeaketh of two or three, then he ſpeaketh of two or three Elders or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt ſpeaketh of two or three.</p>
                     <p>Ergot Chriſt ſpeaketh of two or three Elders or Governors.</p>
                     <p>Further by this argument one Apoſtle could do nothing, but ther muſt needes be two or thre: &amp; ſo one Elder can do nothing, but ther muſt needes be two or thre: &amp; ſo your Prelates Monarchy in their dioceſes falleth to the ground but your arguments grow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why Chriſt ſpeaketh of two or thre is for conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Church &amp; Diſciples of Chriſt, teaching that if but two or thre of them at any tyme walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the faith &amp; truth of Chriſt, thoſe two or thre have title to Chriſt &amp; al his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances &amp; have promiſe of audience &amp; acceptance: as alſo to inſtruct the Saynts, to ſtand for the truth againſt multitudes, though they be the ſmalleſt nomber which is three or two, for Chriſt he wil not leave them deſtitute of his preſence and aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>Your Fourth reaſons that Tel the Church is Tel the Elders in this: that the perſon is changed from the ſecond to the third, vſ. 19. if two of you shal agree, &amp;c. whatſoever they shal ask &amp;c: the force of the argument is al one with the ſecond, &amp; ſo hath receaved anſwer there, but it ſeemeth you delight in nomber &amp; multitude: yet for further evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I will show you the reaſon: the frame whereof is thus to be conceaved.</p>
                     <p>Iff ther be a Grammaticall change of the perſon, viz: you: they: then ther is a Reall chandg off the perſon phyſicall, viz: The Governors: The Church.</p>
                     <p>But ther is a grammatical chandg of the perſon, you: they.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: Ther is a Real chandg of the perſon phyſicall, viz: The Governors: the Church.</p>
                     <p>I deny your Major, &amp; ſtil I avouch that the chandg of the perſon is by way of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. teaching: that they: &amp; you: are one: namely, whither they be two of Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples then living (viz:you) or any other two or thre to the end of the world, (viz: they,) Chriſt hath promiſed his powre, preſence, &amp; acceptance to them: For ſo he ſaith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever two or thre, vſ. 20. &amp; Mat. 28.20. Lo I am with you alwayes: So that theſe two general circumſtances of place &amp; tyme are for the conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; inſtruction of the Church if they be but two or three in al ages: For not the multitude, but the truth is reſpected of Chriſt: &amp; al tymes &amp; places are indifferent for the Church of the new Teſtament which was otherwiſe in the old Teſtament: For the Lord then promiſed his preſence eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Temple, vppon their Sabbaths, &amp; to the ſpecial people: but now the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wal is broken downe, &amp; now al tymes, places, &amp; perſons are indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the church &amp; the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Your fifth reaſon that Tel the Church is Tel the Governors is this: that otherwiſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdityes cannot be avoyded that ariſe out of the text: the abſurdityes you ſuppoſe would follow are, 1. confuſion, 2, careleſnes, wherevppon follow pride &amp; contention, 3. weomen &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaking in the Church, 4. that the whole Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak. 5. Chriſts should croſſe himſelf, who giveth the powre to two or three.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer: the ſuppoſed abſurdities either do not follow, or if they do folow are no abſurdities: For the truth is not abſurd.</p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:3153:38"/>
                     <p> Firſt, it doth not follow that ther muſt needs be confuſion, careleſnes, pride, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, if a brother be promoted to the body of the Church for his offence after once &amp; twiſe admonition: but rather the brethren vnderſtanding that al are intereſſed in the buſines wilbe careful to diſchardg their dutyes, whereas by your fancy the care &amp; chardg being caſt vppon the Elders &amp; from the brethren, they may wholly neglect the matter, &amp; the Church grow corrupt through the Elders partiality negligence, or other ſiniſter reſpect: &amp; for confuſion: it is not intended as you groſſely imagine that al should ſpeake, but that al should conſent: For as in prayer one ſpeaketh &amp; al the Church conſent: So in publique admonition &amp; excommunication one ſpeaketh at once &amp; the reſt conſent: &amp; if any man have any thing to ſay he may ſpeake, &amp; the firſt hold his peace, as, in Prophecy ſo in admonition by proportion, 1. Cor. 14.30. &amp; yet the Lords o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>der not be violated. &amp; if pride &amp; therevppon contentions do ariſe it is through the corruption of men, not through the ordinance of God, &amp; may ther not much more pride grow in the Elders think you when they are abſolute Lords (as it were) over the people? &amp; wil not that breed much more contention? And to contend for the truth is good and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, yea &amp; contentions muſt be in the true church, but woe be to thoſe by whome they come.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you ſay the whole Church cannot ſpeake joyntly, nor ſeverally, one by one except weomen &amp; children ſpeak: I deny it: the whole Church may ſpeake joyntly as in prayer &amp; propheſying, 1. Cor. 11.4. So alſo in admonition &amp; excommunication, by ſome perſons deputed therto either Elders if ther be any, or other if ther be no Elders: &amp; for the ſpeaking of weomen in the Church I ſay it needeth not: for they, &amp; ſo al the brethren may ſpeake by ſilence: or if any diſſent they may ſpeak either woman or youth, &amp; yet the rule of the Apoſtle not violated, who forbiddeth weomen to lead the action of worship in prayer or propheſy, or praiſing God, or any action of Government in the preſence of men: but he doth not forbid a woman to ſpeake when she is called therto, in matter of Government: neither doth the Apoſtle intend to forbid weomen to pray or propheſy in the preſence of weomen only, as ſomtyme the occaſion may be miniſtred if the church conſiſt only of weomen: that this is ſo you shal perceave by comparing theſe places, 1. Cor. 14.34. 1. Tim. 2.12, &amp; conſidering the reaſons of the Apoſtles prohibition: but let vs ſee the force of your argument.</p>
                     <p>If tel it to the Church be tel it to the body of the Church: then every member of the Church muſt ſpeake in rebuking the partie.</p>
                     <p>But every member muſt not ſpeak in rebuking the partie that is promoted to the Church for ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Therfor tel it to the Church is not tel it to the body of the Church, &amp; ſo it muſt needes be tel it to the Elders.</p>
                     <p>I deny your conſequent, for al may heare, take notice give conſent, &amp; ſpeake if they ſe juſt cauſe orderly, &amp; yet it followeth not that al are bound to ſpeake vocaly one by one: For ſilence is a ſufficient teſtification of conſent: Further I ſay your minor is weake: For every one is bound to ſpeak that ſeeth juſt cauſe or els he shall ther by ſtrangle his conſcience, and quench the Spirit, and ſuffer ſinne which he cannot do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Chriſt croſſeth not himſelf, in giving powre to two or thre: For he may give
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3153:39"/>powre to two or three if ther be no more, &amp; yet to twenty, an hundreth, a thouſand, if ther be ſo many: but you Mr. Bern, raiſe vp falſe expoſitions, &amp; wrack the text to ſupport hereſies, therby making the Scriptures a leaden rule to frame to your crooked conceipts, &amp; a noſe of waxe to be wrung which way your perverſe apprehenſions incline.</p>
                     <p>Your ſixth reaſon that tel the Church is tel the Governors is this: that els the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans offended who were al commaunded to deale with the inceſtuous Corinth. &amp; yet ſome only did ſo: &amp; Paul should ſinne who vppon the advertiſement of Cloes howſe, did not wayt for the churches conſent, but himſelf alone determined the matter, &amp; wils them to exente his ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cein the open congregation.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: al the Corinths did deale with the inceſtuous perſon though many ſpake the reſt giving conſent to their ſpeeches: &amp; therfor ther can no more ſinne lye vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for not rebuking by voice, then ther lyeth ſinne vppon the whole Church, for not lifting vp their voice to ſpeake in prayer &amp; propheſy, being al commaunded ſo to do: beſides all might ſpeake: for many ſomtyme ſignifieth al, as I have already shewed: but this is but idle ſtuffe which you object. Furthermore Paul was an Apoſtle having powre &amp; infalibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to plant &amp; direct &amp; reforme Churches, &amp; wil you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence fetch a rule for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual government of the Church? it followeth not Paul did thus: go, one Prelate may do thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay by your owne expoſition ther muſt nedes be two or thre Prelates: but what did Paul? did he performe the whole decree of excommunication? I deny it vtterly: but the Apoſtles meaning is that he for his part gave his voice, &amp; adviſe, &amp; commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as having rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ved grace to be faithful) that the inceſtuous perſon should be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: &amp; note it wel Mr. Ber. Paul doth bid the Elders (as you ſay) excommunicate him: ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things agre? I beleeve your wit was wandering when you wrote theſe things: for you avouched out of the 2. Cor. 2.6. that many Elders did exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate the inceſtuous perſon: &amp; now you ſay that Paul at the information of Cloes Family, like a Lord Bb. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees the ſentence of excommunication in his court, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth them to pronounce it: you gave this powre of late to the Elders, &amp; now you take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Elders, &amp; give it to Paul, &amp; make the Elders only his deputyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>I</hi> wil shew you the reaſon of this your overſight &amp; contradiction: you had by you in your ſtudy when you penned your book, the writings of the Reformiſts, &amp; the writings of the Prelates: &amp; being in wrath &amp; choler enraged againſt vs of the Seperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you thought to make Herod &amp; Pilate frends againſt Chriſt, &amp; have gathered both the Prelates &amp; Reformiſts objections againſt vs &amp; put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe in your book without judgment, &amp; ſo through the weaknes of your vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not diſcerning the reaſons of the Reformiſts &amp; Prelates to contradict, bicauſe they fitted you againſt vs, you not regarding the truth but the victory, have fallen into this groſſe contradiction which your learning can never ſalve: only your repentance &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion can cure it.</p>
                     <p>Your laſt reaſon that tel the Church is tel the Elders is this: for that al reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches judg ſo: wel: yet you ſaid even now that tel the Church is tel the Apoſtle Paul, &amp; the Lord Bb. by conſequent his ſucceſſors: are you in your right mynd Mr. Ber. that ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thus? but you ſee what it is to reſiſt the truth.</p>
                     <p>But what if al the reformed Churches ſay ſo: is it ſo? if the Scripture ſay contrary it is not ſo: &amp; the Churches muſt be reformed yet further according to the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Finaly, you prove that figuratively the part may cary the name of the whole: who
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3153:39"/>denyeth it? &amp; that therfor the Elders are called the Church: <hi>I</hi> deny that. For it foloweth not: yet I yeeld you thus much (which you shal gaine nothing by) that two or three El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may be termed a church being ſeveraly by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, but jointly with the body they are not ſo: ſo a Chriſtian family, or rather the Chriſtians in a family may be truly termed a church ſeveraly: yet jointly with the body they are not ſo: For know you Mr. Ber. that the parts of the Church are ſimilares &amp; Homogoncae: as every part of water is water, ſo every part of a Church, if they be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, is a Church being ſevered neceſſarily from the whole: you ſay alſo that a company without officers no where is called a Church (Chriſtian families only excepted) in al the new Teſtament except Act. 14, 23. by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion. Firſt you muſt prove vnto me Mr. Ber. that this place Act. 14.23. is by anticipation: For doth it follow bicauſe heaven &amp; earth are ſo called by anticipation Gen. 1.1. therfor a company wanting officers are called a Church by anticipation? beſides you ſpeake fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely, ſaying that in al the new teſtament a company without officers is not caled a church: what ſay you to Act. 19.41. any company of people is called a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rch in that place: and whereas you confeſſe that a Chriſtian family is called a Church by the warrant of the new Teſtament, you yeeld the cauſe: For if two or thre faithful perſons of a family are a Church, then two or thre faithful perſons of divers families are a Church: or els shew you a found reaſon to the contrary: hence I reaſon thus.</p>
                     <p>They which the Scripture cal a Church, are a Church.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture calleth two or thre beleevers in a family a Church.</p>
                     <p>Therfor: two or thre beleevers in a family are a Church.</p>
                     <p>Againe: If two or thre beleevers of one family are a Church: then two or thre belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of divers families are a Church by proportion.</p>
                     <p>But two or thre beleevers of one family are a Church, by your confeſſion &amp; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Therfor: two or thre beleevers of divers families are a Church.</p>
                     <p>But know, Mr. Ber. that we ſtrive not about the word, but about the matter: bee they Eccleſia, Synagoge, Diſciples, brethren, Saints, we regard not the word: we ſay that two or thre Diſciples, Saints, brethren, are Sinagoge, Eccleſia, a congregation with whome Chriſt is preſent, who have Chriſts powre, vnto whome every member of the body muſt be promoted for ſinne, this you neither have diſproved, nor ever shalbe able: &amp; heer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth your digreſſion: &amp; now you come vnto your ſixth reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Your 6. reaſon againſt popularity is a repetition of things already anſwered in the fifth reaſon, that Tell the Church is Tel the Governors: Therfor I referre the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thither.</p>
                     <p>Your 7. reaſon againſt popularity is that it is againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of Chriſt: For Heb. 13.17. 1. Pet. 5.2. the sheep muſt obey the shepheard, &amp; the flock muſt depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Paſtor: &amp; he is not to obey them or depend vppon them.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: To the place Heb. 13.17. I ſay the Apoſtle doth not intend to teach that the whole body of the Church muſt yeeld to the voice of the Elders in every thing that they liſt: nor that the Eldership hath in their hands the powre of Chriſt to rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their liking: For the Lord ſubmitteth both Paſtors &amp; Flock vnto his owne lawes &amp; wil: but the intent of the Apoſtle is to show that al the particular members in al their affaires muſt ſubmitt themſelves to the inſtruction direction &amp; guidance of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3153:40"/>Elders: For although Chriſt hath placed the Elders as ſtewards over the Servants, yet he hath not appointed them as Lords over his ſpowſe &amp; wife: your argument therfor is a fallacian a conjunctione &amp; diviſione, thus.</p>
                     <p>Al the particular members muſt obey the Elders in their lawful inſtructions, &amp; their wholſome admonitions ſeverally.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, the whole body muſt jointly obey the voice of the Elders.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the whole Flock conſiſteth of two parts, Officers, and the Saints: The Saints muſt obey the Officers, that is one part of the Church muſt be directed by another, as the foote by the eye: yet the whole body jointly is above any one member or mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers apart.</p>
                     <p>Further al the Saints shal yeeld obedience to Elders in things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by God, &amp; the Elders shal al of them obey the voice of the church in things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by God, but the queſtion is how far the sheep muſt obey the Elders who are shepheards, &amp; how far the Elders which are the L. Servants muſt obey the wife &amp; ſpowſe of Chriſt which is the Church: For know you Mr. Ber. theſe things may well ſtand together, that the whole Church may obey the Elders in ſome things: &amp; the Elders muſt obey the body of the Church in other things.</p>
                     <p>The other place 1. Pet. 5.2. to en humin: may aswel be tranſlated with al your beſt abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as, that dependeth vppon you: but I ſay further that the Flock muſt depend vppon the shepheards, as they are sheep, &amp; as they al jointly are the wife of the lamb the beſt members muſt ſubmit to her voice being the voice of her husband &amp; Lord.</p>
                     <p>You eight reaſon againſt popularity is this, that it is againſt common ſence that the parents should ſubmit to the Children, the workman to the work, the Seedſman to the corne.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, neither is it reaſon that the whole body should yeeld to the hand, or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Mr. Or the wife to the mayd. But you know the Church is a body &amp; the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders hands &amp; other parts the church is the Mrs. &amp; the Elders are Servants: but compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not to be vrged further then their intention: leſt we break them in peeces &amp; ſpoyle the proportion: &amp; ſomtyme in ſome caſes the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts may lawfully ſubmit to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the workemen to the work, &amp; the husbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the corne: For you know that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations chandg arguments.</p>
                     <p>Your ninth &amp; laſt reaſon againſt popularity is, that it is againſt the dignity &amp; office of true Miniſters who repreſent Chriſts perſon, having their powre from him &amp; which none but ſuch as repreſent Chriſt can give or take away: But the body of the Church doth not repreſent Chriſts perſon, nor ever did depoſe or make Miniſters: and bicauſe the body of the Church are not Miniſters, therfor they cannot make Miniſters: &amp; ſuch like rotten ſtuffe.</p>
                     <p>I answer: That the Miniſters do repreſent Chriſts perſon I deny not: but avouch that the Church doth much more repreſent Chriſts perſon, who is the Spowſe &amp; wife of Chriſt: &amp; that the Miniſters have their powre from Chriſt I deny not, but al their powre commeth from Chriſt through the body of the Church as I have ſufficiently proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: That the Church hath made Miniſters I have shewed, Act. 1. they choſe an Apoſtle when as yet they were not Apoſtles, they Elected Deacons, Act 6, Now Election is the very eſſence of a true Miniſter: The Church admonisheth an Elder, Col. 4.17. &amp; depoſeth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3153:40"/>falſe Apoſtles, Reve. 2.2. preacheth, prayeth, &amp; worshippeth wanting Elders, Act. 13.22.23 &amp; whereas you ſay that Miniſters only make Miniſters, I answer it is the ground of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion which I have formerly overthrowne: &amp; I ſay that the body of the Church hath in it al miniſterial powre immediately from Chriſt, &amp; your ſlender ſtuffe hath prevailed nothing againſt this truths of the Lords: the vniverſity may make a Doctor, a Bachelor, a Maiſter, &amp; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t not any ſuch thing, but a compound body having a charter from the King for that pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>poſe: a corporation may make a Major &amp; Sherifes, &amp; yet the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a Major or a Sheriffe: So the Church may make Miniſters, &amp; yet the Church it ſelf is not properly an Elder, or Deacon; or VVidow, but a body politique ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving powre to produce ſuch workes by verue of the charter which Chriſt hath given vnto it.</p>
                     <p>And thus Mr. Ber. I have done with you for this point: but Mr. Ains. ſteppeth vp with a new kind of Antichriſtianiſme never heard of before: &amp; he teacheth vs if we wil beleve him, that Chriſts ruling powre is in the Eldership, &amp; that the Pope &amp; Prelates are not Antichriſts for taking into their hands the powre of the multitude, but the powre of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Heer in the firſt place we muſt remember that the powre of Chriſt which we ſpeak of is a miniſterial delegated powre given to man: &amp; that the queſtion is who is the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect of this miniſterial powre, who receave it immediately from Chriſt: I ſay the body of the Church is the firſt ſubject of it, &amp; I ſay that whatſoever the Eldership hath, it hath from Chriſt through the body of the Church; &amp; by the Churches diſpoſition, &amp; this if you deny Mr. Ains. (which I think you do not) I ſay you are therein departed from the faith: The body of the Church having al her powre from Chriſt retaineth &amp; keepeth it intire to it ſelf, &amp; doth not ſo delegate it to any officers, as that she leeſeth it &amp; is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it: neither doth she delegate any powre to her officers, but that which she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly receaved from Chriſt her head, husband &amp; Lord: For Chriſt giveth not a double miniſterial powre, one immediately to the body of the Church which she hath &amp; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth: another mediately to the Eldership by the Churches diſpoſition which the church hath not at al, but is only a conduit pipe to conveigh it to the Eldership: if you hold ſuch a matter, declare it vnto vs out of the word of God &amp; we wil receave it when we ſee it: in the meane tyme we hold that whatſoever the Elders have, they have it from the Church by delegation: &amp; that the Church hath it in ther owne hands, &amp; receaved it from Chriſt by vertue of the covenant God maketh with it in Chriſt, giving Chriſt for King, Preiſt &amp; Prophet to the Church, &amp; therfor the Church hath from Chriſt the head al powre, &amp; al the members &amp; officers of the Church have al their powre from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which they hold &amp; vſe in the body &amp; not Seperated from the body: The Elders as it were the hands are conjoyned to the Church as to the body: The body of the Church is conjoyned to, Chriſt the head: The body hath no powre devided from the head: the hands have no powre divided from the body. So a company of men have no powre Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from Chriſt: an Eldership hath no powre Seperated from the Church: but as all powre floweth from the head to the body, &amp; then to the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds through the body, which is firſt in the body before it come to the hands: So al powre Eccleſiaſtical or miniſteriall is derived from Chriſt to the Church, &amp; then through the Church to the Elders, which is firſt in the Church before it come to the Elders: And as when the hands are cut of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3153:41"/>body ſtil retaineth the powre intire though it wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hands &amp; the powre of the hands is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> in the body: So when the Eldership is depoſed the Church ſtil retaineth the powre of the Eldership, though it want an Eldership: &amp; as the hands can do nothing contrary vnto the liking of the whole body, but the actions of the hands are by conſent of the body: So the Eldership can do nothing contrary to the liking of the Church: but the actions of the Elders muſt be by conſent of the Church: &amp; as thoſe hands are worthy to be cut of that rebel againſt the body &amp; wrong it, or endaunger it: So are theſe Elders worthy to be cut of from the Church that rebel againſt the Church, wrong it, or endaunger it. This is the faith which I hold Mr. Ains &amp; if you hold any other faith, it is not the faith of Chriſt: but let vs ſee what your book wil aford vs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you ſay: Chriſts ruling powre, which the papiſts ſay is in the pope, we ſay not is in the body of the congregation the multitude, but in Chriſt himſelf: &amp; that the Pope is An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt, not for taking into his hands the powre of the multitude, but of Chriſt, to rule &amp; governe the Church as head of the ſame, confutat. of Mr. Bern. pag. 175.</p>
                     <p>You know Mr. Ains, that the Pope doth not aſſume that powre which Chriſt as King hath in his owne hands reſerved to himſelf: but the pope claymeth to be a miniſteriall head vnder Chriſt, having a Miniſterial powre given vnto him by ſucceſſion from Peter: &amp; although it cannot be denyed, but that he doth many actions which are proper works of Chriſts powre Monarchical proper to himſelf, yet that is but the miſinterpretation of his miniſterial headship, not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding how far that miniſterial headship, which he chal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lengeth, extendeth, &amp; it is not his proper clayme to Chriſts office: therfore properly the Pope is not Antichriſt for challendging Chriſts Kingly powre proper to himſelf: but for aſſuming Chriſts Miniſterial powre delegated to his Church: although I do not deny but the Pope enlargeth the delegated powre further then Chriſt hath preſcribed in his word: So that the Pope is Antichriſt in two reſpects. 1. For clayming that powre which Chriſt hath given to the body of the Church, 2. For extending that miniſterial powre beyond the compaſſe which Chriſt hath limited in the word.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you ſay: Chriſts ruling powre, which the Proteſtants ſay is in the Bbs. the Prelates, we do not ſay is in the multitude, but in Chriſt himſelf, &amp; that the Bbs. are very Antichriſts for aſſuming Spiritual juriſdiction aperteyning to Chriſt alone, confut. of Mr. Bern. pag. 175.</p>
                     <p>Heer alſo you cannot be ignorant Mr. Ains. that the Prelates do not challendg that Monarchical powre which is properly inherent in Chriſts perſon, but renounce it vtterly as confidently as you do: but they only challendg that Miniſterial powre which Chriſt (as they ſay) hath delegated to the Apoſtles &amp; their Succeſſors the L.Bbs. neither can you with any good conſcience ſay that they clayme Chriſts Kingly powre, but only they are Antichriſts as the Pope is for two cauſes. 1. For clayming that powre Miniſteriall which Chriſt hath given to the body of the Church. 2. For enlarging that miniſterial powre beyond that compaſſe which Chriſt in his word hath determined.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you ſay Neither that ruling powre of Chriſt, which the Puritanes ſay is in the presbytery, do we ſay is in the multitude: For we acknowledg Chriſt to have ordeyned a presbytery or Eldership &amp; that in every Church, for to teach &amp; rule them by his owne word &amp; lawes: vnto whome al the multitude, the members, the Saints, ought to obey &amp; ſubmit themſelves as the Scriptures teach, confut. of Mr. Bern. pag. 176.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:3153:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p> VVee ſay Chriſts ruling powre is originally &amp; fundamentally in the body of the Church the multitude: &amp; we acknowledg further that the Elders receave by delegation powre from the body of the Church, which powre miniſterial in the hands of the Elders is not ſo large as that which is in the body, but it is rather a leading powre then a ruling powre: neither are the Elders in al the new teſtament (to my knowledg) called Rulers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chontes, but overſeers, leaders, Elders, prohiſtamenoi, wherby the holy Ghoſt would teach that their powre is not to rule, but to leade &amp; direct: I do therefore vtterly diſclaime this your error Mr. Ains, as one part of Antichriſtianiſme in your Church: but you had need expound it wel for the ſatisfaction of the brethren of the Seperation, leaſt you here in deſtroy your conſtitution before you be aware.</p>
                     <p>VVhat we hold concerning the Presbytery I have delivered partly in that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have written in anſwer to Mr. Bern. partly in that which I lately published concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the differences of the Churches of the Seperation in the ſecond part, &amp; the firſt Section, Chap. 5. &amp; 6. wherfor if you hold that Lordly, vſurped, Antichriſtian powre of your Eldership to be that ruling powre which the word of God warranteth, it shalbe your part to juſtifie it, &amp; to rebuke al that gainſt and it, for herein wee vtterly diſclayme your judgment &amp; practiſe: we maintaine that the powre of the Eldership is a leading, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, &amp; overſeeing powre, miniſtery, or ſervice, both in the Kingdom &amp; Preiſthood of the Church, &amp; that the negative voice, the laſt, definitive, determining ſentence is in the body of the Church, wherto the Eldership is bound to yeeld: &amp; that the Church may do any lawful act without the Elders: but the Elders can do nothing without the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the body, or contrary to the body.</p>

               <p>In the next place followeth your ſecond poſition which is this in your copie.</p>
               <p>In holding that one ſinne of one man publiquely &amp; obſtinately ſtood in &amp; not refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a true conſtituted Church doth ſo pollute it that none may communicate with it in the holy things of God til the partie offending be by the Church put out after law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful conviction: you ſay is error: I ſay it is the moſt comfortable &amp; holy truth wee hold in our walking one with another in communion of Gods ordinances.</p>
               <p>This truth ariſeth from the former ground, that al the members of the Church have powre to the cenſures of admonition &amp; excommunication, to bind &amp; loſe: For (obſerve I pray you) that every brother is bound to admonish his brother for a fault he obſerveth in him if he reforme not he muſt take one or two witneſſes &amp; admonish him: if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme not yet, he muſt bring the matter before the Church, ſuppoſe the Church conſiſt of 12. perſons as at Epheſus, Act. 19.7.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3153:42"/>committed by that vnrepenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſon: For God hath commaunded the church to watch over their brethren, &amp; if they do not they hate their brother in ſuffering ſinne to reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him: God hath commaunded that no vncleane perſon should medle with the Holy things, if they doe they profane &amp; polute the Holy things offering violence to the Lords ordinances.</p>
               <p>But it may be you wil ſay that by this meanes we aſſume to our ſelves a kind of perfec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion &amp; puritie in that we wil have no ſinners among vs: I anſwer that you muſt diſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish betwixt our perſons &amp; our communion: we confeſſe our perſons ſeverally every one of vs to be ſubject to ſinne, &amp; that we doe ſinne dayly: &amp; bicauſe of our ſinning nature the Lord hath appointed the ordinances of the viſible Church as helps &amp; meanes to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due this ſinning nature of ours, eſpecially theſe ordinances of admonition &amp; excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which are to be vſed &amp; adminiſtred vppon al &amp; by al as occaſion is offered: Now this is the perfection &amp; puritie of our communion that we ſuffer no vnrepented ſinne, no vnrepentant ſinner among vs, but either we caſt out the ſinne by repentance or the ſinner vnrepentant by excommunication: that our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion may be pure &amp; holy, &amp; the church without ſpot or wrinckle: &amp; that we may be a new lump dayly vnleavened, the leaven being purged out of vs continually: oh Mr. Ber. if you knew but the comfort &amp; powre of the L. ordinances of admonition &amp; excommunication: as we do (bleſſed be our good God) in ſome meaſure, &amp; that growth &amp; reformation which is in ſome of vs thereby, you would be ſo wonderfully ravished with the powre of Gods ordinances, that you would acknowledg the Church to be terrible as an armie with banners, &amp; yet amyable &amp; lovely comely &amp; beauteful: in ſo much as Chriſt himſelf ſaith that the love of the church is faire that she woundeth his hart with one of her eyes, in regard of the beautyful &amp; holy com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion which is dayly maintayned in her by vertue of the cenſures: but your confuſed aſſemblies &amp; al the members of them not only omit, but reject, yea oppoſe al theſe holy ordinances which Chriſt hath given to his Church, &amp; therby you proclaime to all the world that you are of Belial, that is without the yoke of Chriſts ordinances, &amp; you caſt away from you theſe cordes &amp; bandes wherwith wee are bound one to another, &amp; knit faſter &amp; faſter vnto Chriſt our head: &amp; therfor you living thus without the yoke, out of the Lords Holy order, having broken theſe bandes &amp; caſt the cordes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, ming<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling your ſelves vnto, &amp; joyning with al manner of profane perſons that violate al Gods ordinances, how can we have any fellowship, communion, agreement, concord or part with you?

                  <head>Paralleles, Cenſures, Obſervations, aperteyning to the eighth Section.</head>
                  <p>Mr. Ber. in his book intituled the Sep. Schiſme pa. 103. hath theſe wordes, viz: that ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſeaventh error should be to hold: That the ſinne of one man publiquely &amp; obſtinately ſtood in, being not reformed, nor the offender caſt out, doth ſo pollute the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gation, that none may communicate with the ſame in any of the Holy things of God, (though it be a Church rightly conſtituted) til the party be excommunicated.</p>
                  <p>In this eighth Section the poſition is thus vttered by you, &amp; by mee juſtified, viz:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3153:42"/>That one ſinne of one man publiquely and obſtinately ſtood in and not reformed by a true conſtituted Church doth ſo pollute it, that none may communicate with it in the Holy things of God til the partie offending be by the Church put out after lawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
                  <p>Afterward expounding this truth I ſay, that if the Church hold this obſtinate, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, convicted perſon in communion they conſent to his ſinne, as the civil magiſtrate ſuffering wilful murther conſenteth vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ainſ. confutat. of Mr. Bern. pag. 178.179. doth firſt renounce this truth, &amp; denyeth it to be either their judgment or practiſe referring vs to the confeſſion of their faith, Art. 26. wher their judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, that none is to Seperate for offences, but by due order to ſeek redreſſe: &amp; yet afterward affirmeth, that if the Church will not rebuke nor caſt out a man obſtinate and impenitent in wickednes, but plead for him againſt ſuch as call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them for judgment then are all ſuch abettors of the wicked ſinner them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>elves, and that in a high degree: &amp; now not that one mans ſinne, but the ſinne of them al polluteth them.</p>
                  <p>Wel Mr. Ainſ. you &amp; I wil not differ about this point, for wither it be his ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto by them, or their ſin which is a conſent &amp; approbation to his ſinne, or both, I regard not: The truth is the truth, that that one ſinne polluteth them al by contagion, as the leaven leaveneth the whole lump: &amp; although Mr. Bern. hath not ſo plainly &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectely propounded it as he might, yet let it not be denyed for it is the truth he doth chardg vs withal, giving a true expoſition: &amp; I tell you true Mr. Ainſ. you deny the truth, if you deny the poſition: but indeed your denyall, &amp; your affirmation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict.</p>
                  <p>Heer Mr. Bern. for your ſake I wil performe two things: Firſt I wil confirme this truth which we defend againſt you that joyne with open knowne ſinners in the communion of your falſe Church: Secondly, I wil refel your cavils againſt this truth of God, wherin wee walk.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt point I wish you to remember what hath been proved vnto you in the former Section, viz, That Chriſts miniſterial powre is given to the body of the Church: which if it be true as it is proved to be the vndoubted truth of God, then this ſecond po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition followeth neceſſarily therevppon &amp; therefore is to be embraced for the truth of God in like manner: For every conſequent neceſſarily deduced from the Scripture is as wel &amp; as truly the word of truth as that which is in plaine termes expreſſed &amp; noted downe in nomber of wordes. For even as the branches of the tree doe as truly proceed from the root as the great graines or body of the tree, &amp; are al of one kind &amp; nature doth root, body, graynes, &amp; braunches: So a neceſſary conſequent growing by true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe out of the Scripture is aswel &amp; as truly the word of truth as the poſition, or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne, or ſentence is whence it was raiſed, wherfor I frame an argument from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ground afte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r this manner.</p>
                  <p>If they that have Chriſts miniſterial powre to reforme obſtinate convicted ſinners, or to excommunicate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: do neither reforme them nor caſt them out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among them, but ſuffer them ſtil in communion conſenting therby to their ſinn: then the perſons ſo ſuffering &amp; conſenting to ſinne are polluted by contagion of the ſin, &amp; impenitent wicked ſinner.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:3153:43"/>
                  <p> But it may fal out that a Church true in the conſtitution having Chriſts miniſterial powre yet afterward declining may neither reforme an obſtinate convicted, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor caſt him out of their communion, but may ſuffer him ſtil in communion therby conſenting to his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Ergo: a Church truly conſtituted, having Chriſts Miniſteriall powre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation or excommunication, ſuffering and conſenting to ſinne &amp; ſinners convinced are polluted by infection of that ſinne, and of that impenitent obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate convicted ſinner.</p>
                  <p>And ſo by neceſſary conſequent I conclude after this manner.</p>
                  <p>If a Church truly conſtituted be all of them polluted by conſent as is already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, then they do violate and profane all the Holy things of God wherin they pertake: For to the vncleane nothing is cleane, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth. Tit. 1.15. &amp; the Prophet, Eſa. 1.12.</p>
                  <p>But a Church truly conſtituted may grow to polution by conſenting to obſtinate ſinne &amp; ſinners as is already declared.</p>
                  <p>Therfor a Church truly conſtituted may grow to the violation &amp; manifeſt profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of al the Holy things of God.</p>
                  <p>From this evident truth I proceed &amp; reaſon after this manner.</p>
                  <p>To that Church, company, or communion of men we may not joyne in Spirituall communion that violateth or profaneth the holy things of God.</p>
                  <p>But a Church truly conſtituted may grow to the violation &amp; manifeſt profanation of al the Holy things of God.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, to a Church truly conſtituted growne to polute &amp; violate the holy things of God, we are not to joyne in communion.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſe Mr. Ber. the evidence of this truth manifeſted vnto your conſcience, if the Lord vouchſafe you mercy to ſee the truth.</p>
                  <p>Like arguments may be drawne from many places of Scripture: as from Mat. 13.33. compared with 1. Cor. 5.6. an argument may be framed thus.</p>
                  <p>As the whole lump &amp; the feaſt of the paſſeover was leavened with a litle leave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo one open knowne ſinne polluteth the viſible Church, &amp; the holy things therof: for you muſt vnderſtand that the Apoſtle doth not cal vnknowne ſinne leaven: but by leaven he vnderſtandeth ſinne openly knowne, convinced, &amp; vnrepented: els ther could be no communion for men on earth.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle &amp; our Saviour ſaith out of the law that a litle leaven leaveneth the whole lump &amp; feaſt of the paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>Therfor, one ſinne convinced &amp; vnrepented polluteth the viſible church, &amp; the holy things therof: &amp; therevnto may no man joyne.</p>
                  <p>Againe, from perſons ceremonialy poluted, &amp; ſo defiling the Sanctuary of the Lord, as appeareth Nomb. 19.13.20. Hag. 2.14, I reaſon thus.</p>
                  <p>As perſons ceremonialy poluted vnclenſed entering into the Sanctuary of the Lord, or medling with the holy flesh or pottage, did polute the Sanctuary, &amp; the holy flesh, pottage &amp; the reſt: So the viſible Church of the new Teſtament morally poluted &amp; impenitent in ſin medling with the holy things of God polute &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the ſame.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:3153:43"/>
                  <p> But the L. avoucheth by the mouth of his holy Prophets, that perſons ceremonialy vncleane vnclenſed, entering vnto the Sanctuary, or medling with holy flesh or pottage, polute &amp; defile them.</p>
                  <p>Therfor the viſible Church of the new teſtament morally poluted &amp; impenitent in ſin dealing with the holy things do profane them: &amp; therfor no man with good conſcience can joyne with that profanation.</p>
                  <p>Finally: as in the old teſtament the King &amp; Magiſtrates ſuffering ſin vnpunished were poluted therwith by conſent: So in the new teſtament the viſible church (who are Kings Spiritualy, &amp; have committed vnto them the judgments of the L. the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial powre of Chriſt) ſuffering ſinne vnreformed among them, are polluted thereby.</p>
                  <p>But in the Old Teſtament the Kings and Magiſtrates (by your owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Mr. Bernard pag. 94.) were poluted with ſinne vnreformed in the common wealth.</p>
                  <p>Therfor in the New Teſtament the viſible Church (who are Kings Spiritualy, having committed vnto them the judgments of the L. the miniſterial powre of Chriſt) ſuffering ſinne vnreformed among them are poluted therby: &amp; ſo no communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be had with them, leaſt partaking with them in ſinne by conſent, we receave of their plagues.</p>
                  <p>Now you ſe evidently proved by teſtimonies of Scriptures, &amp; by direct conſequents from the ſame, that it is vnlawful for any man to joyne to a Church that was truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, now growne to profane &amp; violate the holy things of God by conſenting to ſin &amp; wicked, obſtinate, convinced, impenitent ſinners: &amp; that therfor much more is it vnlawful to joyne to your falſe churches which never were truly conſtituted ſince the defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichriſt, but remaine in the gulfe of Antichriſtianiſme vnto this day: the firſt point ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>for being manifeſt, the ſecond foloweth to be enterpriſed which is to anſwer the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; cavils which you make againſt this comfortable truth of the L.

                  <p>In the next place you proceed to declare by divers reaſons (ſuch as they are) that to joyne to the holy things when obſtinate impenitent ſinners partake in them is no ſinne: your firſt reaſon is: For that in the old Teſtament ther was no Sacrifice appointed for this: Ergo it is no ſinne: I deny the antecedent: &amp; I declare the contrary by the examples of the tribe of Bemjamin conſenting to the ſinne of adultery committed vppon the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites concubine, Iudg. 19. &amp; 20. of the tribes of Iſrael, fearing leſt wrath should fal vppon them for ſuffering their brethren to make another altar, &amp; to forſake the true worship of God as they ſuſpected, Iosh. 22. &amp; of Achans ſin which brought wrath vppon the whole congregation. VVherefore in the law the Lord did appoint a Sacrifice for the whole congregation aswell as for any particular perſon. Levitt, 4.13.</p>
                  <p>A Second reaſon of yours is: For that in the Old Teſtament the Godly are never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for being preſent at the miniſtration of holy things though wicked men were pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent: but the Prophets reprove the Preiſts only for not Seperating the cleane from the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cleane. wherto I anſwer that their communion was typical, &amp; therfor perſons typically cleane though wicked in their lives might come to Sacrifice, &amp; yet not pollute others as I have already ſufficiently declared in the former Section: beſides whereas the Prophets reprove the Preiſts, &amp; the Saints in the new Teſtament ſucceed the carnal Preiſts as Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Preiſts, therby it followeth that the Saints in the new Teſtament are polluted by not diſtinguishing &amp; ſeperating the cleane from the vncleane: ſee theſe places of Scripture, Ezech. 22.26. compared with Revel. 1.6. &amp; 11.1. Iude vſ. 23.2. Cor. 6.17.</p>
                  <p>But ſtil ſome may object, that in the old Teſtament they did pray, &amp; preach, &amp; praiſe God, &amp; yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the faithful herein were not defiled if the wicked did joyne with them in communion thereof: &amp; therfor now vnder the new Teſtament, though me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do joyne in communion with open known ſinne, &amp; ſuffer known ſinne yet may be ſaynts, &amp; vnpolluted in communion: &amp; this is the very pith &amp; warrow of your ſecond abjection Mr. Bern. wherto I make anſwer many waies.</p>

                  <p> Laſtly, for the conſequence of the argument, viz: That ſeing in the Old Teſtament the faithful were not defiled joyning in prayer, preaching &amp; praiſing God with open known ſinners, therefore wee in the New Teſtament ſo doing are not defiled, I deny vtterly: yea and I deny the Antecedent in ſome ſence alſo: It shall not be vnprofitable therefore fully to diſcuſſce both the Antecedent, and the conſequence of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is thus to be expounded &amp; conceaved of, namely.</p>
                  <p>That the L. required one thing outwardly in the communion of the Church, another thing inwardly in the hart for acceptation before God.</p>
                  <p>If any circumcized Iſraelite or proſelyte clenſed according to the purification of the Sanctuarie did joyne in prayer, preaching &amp; praiſing God, no man could juſtly refuſe his outward communion in theſe actions ſeing he was outwardly cleane according to the diſpenſation of thoſe tymes: For vs in the new Teſtament ther are required other viſible actions for our outward clenſing, which were not then required of the carnall Iſraelites for their outward clenſing: if they did declare their inward repentance by Sacrifices for their ſinnes general &amp; Speciall, by clenſing themſelves with thoſe rites &amp; ceremonies which were appointed by the Lord for thoſe infant tymes of the Church, they were to be judged holy by al men, &amp; ſo communion might be had with them without ſinne: but if they were not clenſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary, they were not viſibly cleane, &amp; therfor communion could not be had with them without ſinne, &amp; ſo Hezechiahs prayer importeth, 2.

Hag. 2.14. yet heer alſo cautions muſt be remembred, viz: That this ceremoniall vncleanenes muſt be made known vnto others, for otherwiſe how could it polute others if it were vnknowne to them: Furthermore it cannot be denyed, but that the Sonnes of Belial very vild wicked men did deale with the holy things in the old Teſtament, but yet I ſay it cannot be proved but they were viſiblie cleane according to the diſpenſation of thoſe tymes: the Lord did not then require men to proceede with their brethren in the thre degrees of admonition, &amp; ſo to bring them to the acknowledgment of their ſinne &amp; repentance. That is the Lords diſpenſation for the new Teſtament: But the L. order for thoſe tymes was 1. reproof for ſinne, Levit. 19.17. 2. The partie reproved was to offer a Sacrifice which if he did he was clenſed from hys ſinne viſiblie, Levit. 4.23. 3. If he wilfully refuſed to harken he was to be promoted to the Magiſtrate, &amp; put to death for his preſumption, Levit. 15.30.31. Deut. 17.12. This was the L. aeconomie for thoſe tymes when this order was violated, then al communion was defiled, whiles it was obſerved all was wel in the viſible communion: Let any man declare the contrary if he be able: breefly therfor to make a ful anſwer to the objection: if the faithful did keep communion with perſons viſiblie vncleane, (according to the vncleanenes of the old Teſtament,) knowne vnto them, I ſay they were polluted with their vncleanenes by conſenting therto, &amp; to the violation of the Lords order appointed for thoſe tymes: if men were the children of Belial, &amp; yet were clenſed according to the diſpenſation of the Old Teſtament, their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible clenſing did intitle them to the ordinances of the old Teſtament before men, though before God their conſciences were impure: wherfor both the Antecedent &amp; conſequent of the argument are weake and vnſound: &amp; ſo this truth of God remayneth firme, that impenitency in ſinne defileth the communion of the viſible Church, as in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</p>

                  <p> Your third reaſon is for that the Prophets did not Seperate who did know the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the L. for this thing, nor taught not the people ſo to do: I answer as in the new Teſtament ſo in the old ther ought not to be Seperation til the vtmoſt meanes be ſought for redreſſe of things: The vtmoſt meanes for reforming abuſes in the Old Teſtament was the Magiſtrates authority, in whoſe hands the powre of reforming was: Hence it is that the Prophets alwayes reproove the Kings for the wickednes of the Land: but the Lord did never teach (bicauſe he thought it not meet, ther being but one true Church) that when the King neglected his duty the people should forſake the Holy things of God &amp; Seperate, but ſtil they ought to depend vppon the Lord for redreſſe of things: but now in the New Teſtament the Lords adminiſtration in this particular is otherwiſe, 1.

I would have you note this wel &amp; lay it vp in your hart for your inſtruction &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, for in this particular I know you al that feare God in the land are ſcandalized from the truth, not vnderſtanding the difference between the New Teſtament &amp; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances thereof, &amp; the Old Teſtament with the ordinances thereof: Summarily therefor to deliver the truth: The Church, Miniſtery, VVorship, &amp; Government of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ſo conſtituted by the Lord as that no Seperation could be made from them ſeing they were al by Succeſſion &amp; the people therfor were neceſſarily bound over vnto them, otherwiſe they could not find the Lord &amp; his truth which was only at Ieruſalem: in the New Teſtament, the Church, Miniſtery, VVorship &amp; Government are ſo conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Lord, as that in them ther is no Succeſſion nor alligation of tyme, place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp;c. But when the Church is become falſe by impenitency, the faithful may Seperate &amp; cary the truth with them if but two or three.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bern. the L, open your eyes, &amp; the eyes of al his people in England to ſee this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed truth of the Lord: &amp; then the cauſe of Separation wilbe evident vnto your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the meane tyme you cannot but be ignorant.</p>
                  <p>A ſouth reaſon whereby you would prove that to joyne to the Holy things in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3153:45"/>communion of obſtinate impenitent perſons is no ſinne, is, for that the Scripture teacheth the contrary (as you ſay) two wayes, 1. by acquitying the Godly from the transgreſſion of others, 2. by declaring it to be a ſinne to leave the Holy things of God, for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of others: &amp; this you ſay cutteth deepely.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer you Mr. Ber. that we do not feele this cut at al, for the iron is blunt, &amp; you had need put to more ſtrength, &amp; your reaſon hath in it no cutting quality at all: For I doe acknowledg that the Godly, if they conſent not to, nor approve not the ſinne of others, are by the Lords ſentence acquit from the transgreſſion. but I would learne of you, if the Holy Ghoſt in the Scripture doth not account the principal &amp; the acceſſary in the lame condition though not in the ſame degree of ſinne: what ſay you to the ſinne of Achan? the ſinne of the men of Gibean concerning the Levites concubine? The feare of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites in reſpect of the Altar built in the border of the Land of Canaan by Iorden? Theſe places are evident, that conſent to ſinne polluteth the perſon conſenting: &amp; the places by you quoted do not prove any thing contrary to this aſſertion of ours: but rather they prove this vndoubted truth of the Lords: the place Ezech. 33.9. proveth that as the watchman that diſchargeth his duty is acquit, ſo if he diſcharg not his duty he shalbe ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſinne, &amp; partaker of the punishment as may be ſeen, vs. 6. the place Ezech. 18.14.17.20. doth declare two things, that if the child follow not the ſinne of the parents he shalbe guiltleſſe: if he partake in ther ſinnes he shalbe partaker of the. punishment the place Ezech. 14.18.20 sheweth that Noah, Daniel, &amp; Iob shal deliver their owne ſoules by their righteouſnes: but al thoſe that are polluted with other mens ſinnes shal partake of their plagues, Revel. 18.4. So that you ſee theſe places of the old teſtament quoted by you do not only not help you, but vtterly overthrow your conceipt.</p>
                  <p>The places of the new Teſtament alledged by you alſo make as litle for you. Tit. 1.15. teacheth that al thing are pure to the pure, yet the intent of the place is not to shew that ſinne is pure to any man: &amp; although I may lawfully vſe the Holy things of God being my ſelf cleane: yet being partaker of another mans ſinne by conſent, I polute al the holy things to my ſelf, &amp; have no title to vſe them, &amp; ſo the Apoſtle ſaith preſently to the impure is nothing pure: the place Revel. 3.4. teacheth that ſo many of the Church at Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di as defiled not their garments by conſenting to the polution of the reſt of that Church, but that ſtood out againſt their corruptions to the vtmoſt, shalbe innocent: &amp; the other place, Revel. 2 22-24. sheweth the ſame thing: but for theſe two places I ſay: you muſt prove Mr. Ber. that your aſſemblies are true churches as theſe were: againe, you muſt prove alſo that theſe perſons neglected their duty of admonishing &amp; ſtanding forth againſt the Church: &amp; that the church was convinced by them &amp; yet did joyne with them in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion of Holy things: For otherwiſe we ſay we are not to Seperate till wee have done our vtmoſt endevour: neither are we poluted til then: your laſt place is Gal. 5.10. wher the Apoſtle teacheth that he that troubleth the Galatians shal beare his condemnation whoſoever he be: &amp; yet the Apoſtle telleth them vs. 9. that a litle leaven leaveneth the whole lump: that is to ſay: if you conſent to this falſe doctrine of joyning circumciſion to Chriſt the perſon that perſwadeth you shal beare his burthen whoſoever he be, yet you alſo shalbe punished receaving the falſe doctrine, but I hope otherwiſe of you: this is the meaning of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you ſay the Scripture teacheth it to be a ſinne for to leave the holy things
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3153:46"/>of God, for the wickednes of other, &amp; for this purpoſes you alledg, 1. Sam. 2.24.17. wher (you ſay) the wordes are plaine, &amp; cannot be avoyded by another expoſition of the word gnabarwell: although the word doth as properly ſignifie to paſſe vppon or to paſſe by as to treſpaſſe, &amp; that it is ſo expounded by Pagnin: yet I will not plead it at this tyme ſith it needeth not: Therfor take the place according to your conſtruction that the Sonnes of Ely by their ſinnes cauſed the people to ſinne by abhorring the L. offering through occaſion of ther wickednes: I anſwer thus: in the old Teſtament no man was to forſake the Sacrifices for other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſinnes if they were ceremonialy cleane: &amp; therfor that the people did abhorre theſe ordinances of God vppon the wickednes of Elyes Sonnes was ther transgreſſion: the L. taught no ſuch thing in the old Teſtament &amp; in the typical communion therof: but now in the new Teſtament we having the truth that was then ſignified by the old Teſtament &amp; the ordinances therof, it followeth neceſſarily thus: that as in the old Teſtament &amp; the communion therof which were typical, perſons typicaly cleane might not have communion typical, with perſons typically vncleane, without po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lution ceremonial: So in the new Teſtament &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion therof which is the truth, perſons moraly cleane may not have Spiritual communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with perſons moraly vncleane without polution moral which is ſinne: &amp; ſo you are anſwered according to your expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the place: yet I deny it to be neceſſary to expound the place ſo as you doe.</p>
                  <p>Your fifth reaſon proving it lawful for the Saints to hold communion in the holy things though perſons obſtinate in ſinne be preſent is: For that in the word we have liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty given to come to partake in the holy things if wee look to our ſelves to reforme our owne wayes, mat. 5.23.24. 1. Cor. 11.28. &amp; the Corinths did partake in the holy things with them that were once &amp; twiſe admonished, 2. Cor. 12.21. go: ſo may we do.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. The place of Chriſt Mat. 5.23.24. teacheth that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt firſt reconcile him ſelf to his brother before he offer his gift: truth: but it muſt be for al the ſinnes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth againſt his brother: now to hate his brother by ſuffering ſinne to reſt vppon him &amp; not to admonish &amp; bring him to repentance, is a greevous ſinne of one man againſt his brother, &amp; ſo it is a very greevous hatred for a man to ſuffer the whole Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed from ſinne, &amp; therfor by this place or Chriſt you gaine nothing, but rather leeſe the cauſe which is hereby confirmed, viz: that til a man doe his duty to the vtmoſt to his brethren, he cannot offer his gift: now his vtmoſt duty is, either to bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or to leave him impenitent, &amp; al them that juſtifie his ſinne in their impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy &amp; ſo in the violation of the holy things: For they being al poluted with his ſinne have deprived themſelves of title &amp; powre to the holy things, &amp; ſo vſing them doe violate them, &amp; al that partake with them therin partake with ſinne, &amp; shall receave of their judgments.</p>
                  <p>The place 1. Cor. 11.28. is alſo againſt you: For the Apoſtle willeth the Corinths to examine themſelves how they have performed their duty to God, &amp; their brethren, in the firſt &amp; ſecond table: &amp; finding themſelves to be cleere then to eate &amp; drinck: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe finding our ſelves to faile in that commaundement, Mat. 14.15-17. wee are poluted by contagion &amp; cannot eate &amp; drinck without hurt &amp; judgment, bicauſe we have not judged our ſelves aright.</p>
                  <p>But your laſt place Mr. Ber. is ſomthing to the purpoſe: viz. 2. Cor. 12.21. &amp; 13.1.2. com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3153:46"/>together, for I wil help to vrge your argument, &amp; then give you an anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Your argument may thus be framed.</p>
                  <p>If the Corinths might without ſinne have communion with the Church, of the Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rinths after they were once &amp; twiſe admonished, &amp; did not repent: then may we have communion, with perſons obſtinate &amp; impenitent, in the holy things without ſinne in vs.</p>
                  <p>But the Corinths had communion with the Church of Corinth poluted with ſin after once &amp; twiſe admonition, without ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Ergo: we may have communion, with perſons obſtinate in ſinne, in the holy things without ſinne in vs.</p>
                  <p>This is the force of your reaſon: wherto I anſwer, that you muſt prove your minor: For it is weake: &amp; the places of Scripture do not confirme it: For you muſt know that the latter Epiſtle to the Corinths was the ſecond admonition as may be ſeen, 2. Cor. 13.2 &amp; before the deſpiſing of the ſecond admonition they could not be judged obſtinate &amp; impenitent in ſinne: now for the ful &amp; ſufficient confirmation of your minor you should prove vnto vs two things: Firſt, that the Corinths did deſpiſe Pauls ſecond admonition in this his ſecond Epiſtle: Secondly that if they did deſpiſe this his ſecond admonition, the faithful among the Corinths did keep communion without ſinne with that poluted &amp; obſtinately impenirent company: now bicauſe I know this is to hard a task for you, I will therefore conclude that this argument of yours is inſufficient to prove your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>Your laſt &amp; leaſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby you endevour to prove it lawful to vſe the holy things though obſtinate impenitent ſinners be preſent in communion, is, that Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement muſt be obeyed abſolutely, &amp; another mans ſinne cannot diſſolve the bond of allegiance betwixt God &amp; man, which our poſition ſeemeth (as you pretend) to diſſolve: ſeing we ſay that a man muſt not keep communion in the holy things if wicked men be preſent in communion with vs:</p>
                  <p>To this argument I anſwer thus: viz: that God indeed commaundeth vs to pray, heare the word, &amp; communicate in the Sacraments, but he alſo preſcribeth both the perſons wherwith, &amp; the manner how we muſt performe theſe actions: prayer, hearing the word &amp; partaking in the Sacraments are actions of communion, &amp; ther is in the preformance of them a manner of doing (modus agendi) to be obſerved: wee muſt therfor reſpect two things in performing theſe actions of Religion: Firſt that our communion be ſuch as it ought to be, for I may not keep communion with Iewes, Turks, Pagans, Papiſts, but with Chriſtians, viz: true Chriſtians ſuch as the new Teſtament deſcribeth ought to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church which is the myſtical body of Chriſt: Secondly, that the actions of our communion be performed after that holy manner &amp; order as the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Chriſt teacheth: as that prayer be conceaved not read out of a ſervice book, that prophecy come out of the hart, &amp; not be read out of a book as Homilies be: that baptiſme be adminiſtred ſimply as Chriſt teacheth without Godfathers, the croſſe, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to infants: &amp; that the L. Supper be vſed ſitting not kneeling. finaly, that al the parts of worship be clenſed according to the primitive inſtitution, &amp; not vſed with thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which the man of ſinne hath caſt vppon them: breefly, we muſt worship God with the meanes he hath apointed as the 2. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teacheth, &amp; after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner he hath
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3153:47"/>taught as the third commaundement informeth, otherwiſe ther is idolatry committed in violating the ſecond commaundement worshipping God by other meanes then he hath ordemed: &amp; profanation of the name of God in violating the third commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when his ordinances are not ſo vſed as he hath preſcribed: So that to ſpeak directly to your objection, the bond of alleageance betwixt God &amp; vs is preſerved &amp; kept invio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lable by our poſition: for we teach that men muſt pray, heare the word, &amp; receave the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, but in a true viſible communion of Sains as the Lord hath appointed, not with al manner of perſons, as theeves, mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And heer Mr. Bern. you take vppon you to reduce the places of Scripture which wee alledg for Seperation from your aſſemblies to certaine topical or categorical heads, &amp; ſo give them anſwer according to your fashion: as thus: the places that forwarne Gods people to Seperate vnder the law are thus to be taken:

                        <item>1. From idols of falſe Gods: as Iſrael from heathenish Gods.</item>

                        <item>1. From lewes not receaving Chriſt, but rayling againſt him.</item>
                        <item>2. From Gentils without Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>3. From Antichriſt vnder the shew of Chriſt perſecuting Chriſtians.</item>

                  <p>But (ſay you) what are al theſe places to vs who are not vnder any of theſe heads of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? I answer you Mr. Ber. that your Church is reſpectively vnder al theſe topical pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which you mention excepting the firſt, For 1. you make Idols of the true God, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp your own inventions, &amp; making Chriſt a King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophet, as you jmagine 2. you ought much more to Seperate from perſons morally vncleane, if the lewes ought to Seperate from perſons ceremonialy vncleane, 3. if the Apoſtles commaund Seperation from the Iewes members of that true Church of the old Teſtament, refuſing Chriſt &amp; rayling againſt him: Then much more ought we to Seperate from you the members of falſe Churches, refuſing &amp; perſecuting Chriſt in his members &amp; new.

                  <p>To end al: you ſay that it cannot be proved that it is ſinn to heare the word preached &amp; to receave the Sacraments of one that hath converted him, &amp; is called of the church, wel Mr. Bern. I vnderſtand your drift, &amp; I wil give you an anſwer: I ſay in your aſſemblies men do not convert to the true viſiole faith of Chriſt taught in his word, viz: in the new Teſtament: nor you ever converted man therto, but pervert men from it, as this book of yours &amp; al your railings againſt our teſtimony do plainly evince: what you do inviſibly the Lord knoweth, &amp; every mans owne conſcience can ſpeak that feeleth: but what ſay you of the Popish preachers do you think they convert none inviſiblie? &amp; what doe you gaine by this fancy? neither they nor you convert to the faith or new Teſtament of Chriſt, but they pervert me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from you, &amp; you pervert men from the Seperation: &amp; both hinder &amp; draw from the truth: what you do inviſiblie I ſeek not nor ought not to reſpect for viſible walking: yet know that we hold that ther are 7000. that are of the Lords E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in your falſe Churches: So are ther in Rome it ſelf. Revel. 18.4. whence did al the worthy witneſſes of Chriſt ariſe, as the waldenſes, Hus, Prage, Luther, the Martyrs in Q. Maries dayes in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; at other tymes in other places? did they not come out of the bottomleſſe pit of Antichriſtianiſme being converted there? yet I hope you wil not ſay that they might ſtil joyne to that miniſtery: &amp; yet the miniſters then had the calling of that church, ſuch as it was: if therfor the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be not good for them no more is it for you: for you wilbe proved to be Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Miniſters as truly in quality, though not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much in quantity as they are: &amp; this shal ſuffice for anſwer to this point.</p>

               <p>Your next point wherto I will ſpeak is the ſixth in nomber: which you hold error, but I hold as a truth if it be wel conceaved: it is this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the word truly preached &amp; Sacraments rightly adminiſtred are no infallible to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kens of a true Church.</p>

                  <p>I cannot find in all Mr. Bern. book intituled the Sep Schiſme, any thing in oppoſition to this Section of my lette vnto him, whereby I collect that he yeeldeth it as a truth: &amp; it is not material to the point of Seperation any thing at al: only the truth muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for the Author of truths ſake that the Lord &amp; his truth may in all things be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored: the ſumme of al this Section is thus much: that as not the act of reaſoning is the true propertie of a man, but the faculty to reaſon: Non ratiocinari ſed rationale: So not the actual preaching &amp; adminiſtring of the Sacraments, but the powre of Chriſt to have &amp; vſe al the holy things of God is the true property convertible, &amp; in fallible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a true Church: For as every man although he be reaſonable, yet doth not actually vſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al tymes, as namely, being an infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, being a ſleep, being in a Lethargie or ſincope So the true Church though it have alwayes powre to al the holy things, yet actually it doth not vſe the powre: But I liſt not to ſpeak much concerning this particular which is more Scholaſticall then profitable, the rather ſeing Mr. Bernard contendeth not about it.</p>

               <p>The next poſition is according to your order the twelvth, viz:</p>
               <p>That every of our aſſemblies are falſe churches, al our miniſters falſe miniſters, our wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship a faiſe worship: you cal this en or, I cannot beleeve you: wherfor I declare them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you particularly in order after this manner.</p>
               <p>But bicauſe your Wordes ſeem to import that you doe not defend all your aſſemblies to be true Churches, all your Miniſters true Miniſters, &amp; the worship of every aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie to be a true worship, for that I geſſe by your covenant you exclude dumb Miniſters, &amp; the aſſemblies over which they are, &amp; the worship offered vp by them: Therefore I wil onely plead againſt your parish Church at workſap, and your owne Miniſterie, and the worship offered vp by you for your people in the parish Church at workſap.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for your aſſemblie I vſe this reaſon to prove it no true Church: wher the people are not Holy, Elect, &amp; faithful, having not entered covenant to walk in all Gods wayes, ſtanding in confuſion with every abhominable liver ſubject to al the Antichriſtian orders &amp; officers ſet over them, deprived of the powre of Chriſt for ther mutuall help &amp; edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ther is no true Church.</p>
               <p>But the parish aſſemblie of workſap is ſuch go, it is no true Church.</p>
               <p>The Major is manifeſt by theſe Scriptures compared together, Math. 15.9. Apocal. 14.9-11. Epheſ. 1.1.4. 2. Corinth. 6.14-18. Math. 28.20. &amp; 5.19. Apocal. 18.4. Math. 5.24.</p>

                     <p>The true Churches of the Apoſtolique inſtitution were by baptiſme gathered into the covenant or new Teſtament of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England are not by their baptiſme conunited into the New Teſtament of Chriſt, but only into the conſtitution, miniſtery, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, &amp; government, &amp; into that faith &amp; doctrine which is by law eſtablished in the Land.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: the Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England are not the true Churches of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtolique inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The ground of this argument is this: that the Apoſtles baprized men in definitely into the whole new Teſtament of Chriſt, &amp; al the ordinances thereof, which was not ſtinted or limited at the pleaſure of men vnder certaine canons, injunctions, articles, or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal conſtitutions, but was large, even as large as the whole word of truth then inſpired or written by the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets: whereas the aſſemblies of England do neither them ſelves profeſſe the true ſaith of Chriſt conteyned in the new Teſtament, their faith being ſtinted &amp; limited vnder certaine deviſed articles &amp; convocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> howſe Synodical decrees or conſtitutions, wherevnto al the miniſters of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are bound to Subſcribe &amp; which is the faith of the whole nation: neither therfor do they baptiſe into the new Teſtament of Chriſt indefinitely &amp; ſimply, but reſpectively &amp; definitely into that faith &amp; doctrine which is taught in their ſtinted book of articles, wherto they ſubſcribe which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve &amp; teach, &amp; wherof the body of that Church is, wherin wherto they are by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme admitted &amp; receaved: their faith therfor being deviſed &amp; ſtinted, or falſe: therfore their baptiſme falſe: therfor their covenant falſe: therfor the forme of their Church falſe: &amp; therfor the Church it ſelf a falſe Church: For how can that be a true Church, which hath a falſe faith, covenant, forme?</p>

                     <p>The true Church of the primitive inſtitution Apoſtolical had Chriſt Ieſus for their mediator, that is, for their King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophet.</p>

                     <p>The Minor or ſecond part of the Argument may be confirmed by divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as 1.

                     <p>From theſe places of Scripture compared together, &amp; truly expounded, may an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be drawne framed thus.</p>
                     <p>The true Church of the Apoſtolique primitive inſtitution hath Chriſt for the head, and is a true body vnto the true head Chriſt, truly vnited by the Spiritt of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>The Minor or ſecond part of the Argument may thus be confirmed in the three parts therof, 1. Chriſt is not their true head ſeing they deny all his offices (though they hold the doctryne of his nature and perſons ſoundly) as is plainly proved before in the fifth Argument, 2. the aſſemblies as they ſtand in confuſion with all the vngodly and vitious perſons of the Land, vnder the Antichriſtian Lords and Lawes Eccleſiaſticall, can not be a true body vnto Chriſt, but is a monſtrous body, like vnto the body of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnetzars image: Daniel. 2.32. 3. this monſtrous body cannot be vnited to the true head Chriſt by his Spirit, but the people of the aſſemblies being for the moſt part the ſeed of the Serpent muſt needes be knit together, and vnto their head Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt by the Spirit of Antichriſt, the Spirit of Sathan. All this I ſpeak of their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble communion, and of that politique body Eccleſiaſticall which is called their Church: For otherwiſe I doe acknowledg vnfeynedly, and doe vndoubtedly beleeve that the Lord hath his thouſands among them, even a remnant according to the Election of grace.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I proved vnto you Mr. Bernard poſitively, that the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſſemblies of England in their preſent conſtitution, and walking, are not the true chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the primitive Apoſtolique inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but are in their outward, viſible, politique ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence the churches of Antichriſt, framed after the shape of the popish aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies, though
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3153:51"/>much refined from the venemous droſſe of popery: now in the ſecond place it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that I deale anaskeuaſticos with you answering thoſe things which you alledg for your Churches to prove them true:</p>
                     <p>The great &amp; maine pillar of your building is this, that ſeing your Church hath not a falſe head, falſe matter, falſe forme, falſe properties, therefore it is not a falſe, but a true Church.</p>
                     <p>To theſe 4. particulars I anſwer diſtinctly: Firſt, you have a falſe head in that you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in a fantaſtical Chriſt of your owne deviſing, in that you shape him a Kingdom Preiſthood, &amp; Propheſy of your owne invention, making him a mediator &amp; interceſtor to al the profane people of the Land, cauſing him to offer vp other worship &amp; worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to his Father then he hath taught in his new Teſtament purchaſed by his blood: by this meanes dealing with Chriſt as ſomtyme the Iewes did, putting a reed in his hand, a crowne of thornes vppon his head, &amp; kneeling downe vnto him as to a King, &amp; bidding him prophecy, &amp; yet ſmite him vppon the face, ſpit at him &amp; preſently crucify him: For whereas you frame him a Kingdom, Subjects, Officers, Lawes, &amp; a government after your owne invention, or rather out of the Propes decretals &amp; decrees, hereby you ſeem to make him a King, but indeed you Crucifye him againe, and tread vnder foote the blood of the Teſtament, which he hath purchaſed &amp; eſtablished at ſo high a rate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, your church hath a falſe matter: For ſeing you do al this indignity to Chriſt the head of his true Church, do you think that he wil entertaine you for the true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Church, the true ſubjects of his Kingdom, the true members of his body, the faithful Servants of his howſe, his chaſt &amp; true welbeloved Spowſe &amp; wife? either you muſt repent &amp; reforme your ſelves of al that vild indignity which you offer vnto Chriſt or els he wil never receave you for the matter of his Church, the Subjects of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the members of his body, the Servants of his howſe, his eſpowſed wife: For Chriſt wil not take a wife of fornication, &amp; children of fornication, Hoſ. 1. he wil not have the Servants of Antichriſt to be his howſehold Servants, Mat. 6.24. nor wil he take the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an harlot, &amp; make them the members of Chriſt, 1. Cor. 6.15, &amp; the Subjects of his vtter enemy Antichriſt, cannot poſſibly be the true faithful Subjects of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Luk. 19.27.</p>
                     <p>But in the pa. 111-116. of your book you make a diſtinction of matter, as: No matter True matter, Falſe matter: they are no matter of a church (ſay you) which do not profeſſe Chriſt: as Iewes, Turks, Pagans: They are true matter that profeſſe Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, &amp; the Sonne of Mary, &amp; the only Saviour of man. Falſe matter (ſay you) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true: Further this true matter of the Church (you ſay) is good &amp; bad: good matter (you ſay as it ſeemeth to me) is men walking vprightly in this profeſſion of Chriſt: bad matter are men walking wickedly: &amp; this you illuſtrate by the matter of mariage, for she may be a true wife though a bad one, &amp; alſo by the ſimilitude of ſubjects to a King, who may be true, though bad ones, breaking his lawes: &amp; a true tradeſman though vnskilful in his profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; for your ſelves you ſay you are true matter of Chriſts church (though not good matter) bicauſe you profeſſe Chriſt truly as is ſaid before: wel Mr. Ber. I yeeld the general diſtinction of matter, but I deny the particular application of it to your ſelves: &amp; I ſay you are falſe mater: how therfor do you prove vnto vs that you are

                        </gap>ue matter? by 4. reaſons: wherof the firſt is for that you beleving this forſaid truth you beleeve the ſumme of the goſpel: I deny it vtterly: the ſumme of the gospel is this, that Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, &amp; the Sonne of Mary, is the only King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophet of his Church, governing, Sacrificing, making interceſſion, &amp; prophecying after that holy manner &amp; according to thoſe rules which he hath preſcribed in his Teſtament: Now to beleeve truly concerning the perſon of Chriſt, &amp; to beleeve falſely concerning his office as you doe, is not to beleeve the whole goſpel, but only a peece of it: So that this is the doctrine alone by which the Apoſtles did gather a people to make them a Church &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt: &amp; the profeſſion herof admitted men as true matter of a Church: &amp; this only differenceth the true Church from Iewes, Turkes, Pagans, Papiſts, &amp; al other Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians &amp; Heretiques, viz: Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophet, &amp; media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of his owne Teſtament: Therfor your ſecond, third, &amp; fourth reaſons fal flat to the ground, the firſt being vnderminded as you ſee: but ther is one thing that I wonder at: that you should hold the Papiſts to be falſe matter of a Church for holding juſtification by workes, therby denying Chriſts Preiſthood &amp; hold your ſelves to be true matter of the Church denying Chriſts Kingdom in the true frame, miniſtery, worship, &amp; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church: what is not Chriſts Kingdom as pretious as his Preiſthood? is it not as horrible impiety to deny Chriſts Kingdom, &amp; the ordinances therof: as to deny his Preiſthood &amp; the vertue therof? or is Chriſts Preiſthood more fundamental then his Kingdom? or juſtification by workes more pernitious then to deny Chriſt to raigne as King, &amp; to refuſe his regiment? wel if the papiſts be falſe matter by your owne confeſſion for the one, you muſt needes alſo be falſe matter for the other: For I am confident that Chriſts Kingdom is as pretious an office as his Preiſthood, even as the Kingdom in the old Teſtament was as excellent as the Preiſthood: now Mr. Bern. what is become of the Church ſeing your matter is falſe as you may perceave by this deſcription? &amp; what shall your ſimilies of a bad wife, a bad ſubject, of a bad artificer help you? you ſee they vanish away as chaffe before the wind: your matter is falſe &amp; not bad, as appeareth evidently if you wil not be blind.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, pag. 116-122. of your book you deſcribe vnto vs the true forme of the Church, inwardly, to be the Spirit, Faith, &amp; Love: &amp; outwardly, the word, profeſſion, &amp; the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the L. Supper: &amp; theſe things (ſay you) are in your aſſemblies: Ergo: you conclude your Church hath a true forme.</p>
                     <p>I answer: have not the Papiſts the word preached? do not they make profeſſion &amp; live as ſtrictly as you? do not they communicate in the L. Supper? &amp; ſo by conſequent have Love, Faith, &amp; the Spirit? yet you ſay they are falſe Churches, wanting the true forme, even ſo are you although you do al that they doe, &amp; much more, (for ſo you are much bettered in doctrine &amp; vſe of the Sacrament, but in profeſſion &amp; practiſe I ſuppoſe you are inferior to many of them:) bicauſe rejecting Chriſt in his offices as hath been ſaid eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecialy in his Kingdom, it is impoſſible in that conſtitution &amp; communion, you should aright vſe the word, make profeſſion, &amp; partake in the Sacrament, or have the true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Love, Faith, &amp; Spirit of Chriſt: For a falſe matters vncapable of a true forme: &amp; it is impoſſible that the body of Antichriſt should have the true Spirit of Chriſt, or the true covenant &amp; new Teſtament of Chriſt inveſted vppon them: inviſibly I hope wel &amp; am perſwaded of millions among you: but I ſpeake of your viſible, politique, body Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3153:52"/>in that mixture of perſons, &amp; ſubordination of Eccleſiaſtical officers, &amp; communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spiritual in the Holy things, which by Law is eſtablished &amp; ſupported in your Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>But pag. 121. you bid vs note this: what? viz: that corruptions doe not hinder men from being a true Church before men, no more then the corruptions of the hart do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man from being an elect one inviſiblie to the Lord: I ſuppoſe bicauſe you bid vs in the margent of your book note this, that you account it a matter worth noting: and I ſurely think it a note worth nothing: For although corruptions of matters accidentall make not a falſe Church, yet corruptions eſſential of matters eſſential make a falſe church namely, if the matter be falſe or the forme falſe: yea I avouch that if a truly conſtituted Church detected of corruptions accidental, convinced, &amp; impenitent therin, do ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, they become a falſe Church as hath been proved already before in the 8. Section: for impenitency inward or outward, maketh a falſe Chriſtian &amp; Church, inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, according to due proportion.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, pag. 122-128. you bring vs three true viſible properties of your true Church as you ſay, 1. continuance in the vſe of the word, Sacraments &amp; prayer, 2. the holding forth of the truth againſt the enemyes thereof, 3. mutual care for the welfare each of other: &amp; al theſe (you ſay) you have among you, &amp; ſo you ſay you muſt needes be a true Church.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: Seing your matter and forme is falſe, your propertyes cannot be true: For they ariſe neceſſarily from the vnion of the matter and forme, or from the forme induced vppon the matter: ſeing therefore the firſt is already proved, the latter alſo muſt needs follow: but let vs examine theſe things particularly: I denie therfor in the firſt place that you have wel propounded the propertyes of the true Church: For the firſt and principal eſſential property of a true Church is intereſt and title to al the Holy things, which is extant in divers particulars as parcels of that general and whole property. ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore a people declaring their faith and repentance by Seperating themſelves from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenes, &amp; by reſigning themſelves wholy to the Lord to become his people, have God for their Father, &amp; Chriſt for their King, Preiſt, and Prophett, and ſo with Chriſt have title to all the meanes of Salvation: and this title conſiſteth in the VVord, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Cenſures, Prayers, Almes, and al other parts of Spirituall viſible communion whatſoever: even as when the ſoule is induced vppon the matter, viz: when the breath of life is breathed into the noſthrils of duſt of the Earth. Geneſ. 2. then ther is a man with a reaſonable and Religions Soule: So when a company of faithful people are inveſted with the New Teſtament of Chriſt, then ther is in them title to al the holy things of God whatſoever: This is evident by that which I have before manifeſted in the ſeaventh Section whither the Reader is to be referred: wherfore Mr. Bern. to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this vnto your Church, I avouch that ſeing you are a falſe matter of a Church: and have a falſe forme or covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t induced vppon you, as hath been shewed before, therefore you have no true title to the meanes of Salvation, but in vſurping the VVord, Sacraments, Cenſures, Prayers, Almes, &amp;c. you therein incurre the reproof of the Prophet, ſaying: Pſalm. 50.16. what haſt thou to doe to declare myne ordinances, that thou shouldeſt make my covenant into thy mouth, ſeing thou hateſt to be reformed, and haſt caſt my
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3153:52"/>wordes behind thee? And as the Prophet ſpeaketh: Eſay. 1. 11-18. your worship is iniquity, I cannot beare it, I am weary of it, I hate it: Therefore you may plead as long as you will the Temple of the Lord: the Temple of the Lord: yet I ſay, vntill you intertayne Chriſts true Kingdome, Preiſthood &amp; Prophecy, you are but vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of all that viſible communion in the Word, Sacraments, Prayers, &amp;c. which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you: For it doth not follow that bicauſe you have the Word, Sacraments, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, prayers, &amp;c. therefore you are a true Church: neither are the vſing of theſe, true propertyes of a true Church: But the title to them is the true propertie of a true Church: For the Papiſts and all Antichriſtians and Heretiques vſe the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Cenſures, prayers, but they are not therfor a true Church, as I know you will confeſſe.</p>
                     <p>But heer you wish vs againe pag. 122. to obſerve well: Lett vs heer what it is that you wish vs to obſerve well: Namely, the true VVord preached, and the true Sacraments adminiſtred, are the true propertyes to a true Church: And that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve thoſe things as you ſay: well: VVhat is the true word? and what are the true Sacraments: is not the true word the true doctryne of the word? the true doctryne of the New Teſtament? but you have rejected the whole doctryne of Chriſts Kingdome in a manner, and have advanced all that falſe doctryne of the Antichriſtian hierarchy, which is taught and commaunded by Law to be taught in your Church: And you in your pulpits proclayme all them Heretiques or Schiſmatiques, that teach and erect the Church, Miniſterie, VVorship, and Government, according to the paterne of Chriſt his New Teſtament: And ſo you have abrogated and diſanulled the VVord of God by your traditions and Antichriſtian deviſes. Againe: VVhat are true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? is the breaking of bread, and drincking of wine performed by any perſons, after any manner, or washing with water likewiſe, true Sacraments? I think you will not ſay it: it is therefore neceſſary that there bee a concurrence of other matters: viz: That ſeing Sacraments are in relation and reference, thoſe references or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt needes be annexed, els they are not true Sacraments: as a baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, muſt baptize into the true Faith of Chriſt, a perſon capable of baptiſme: A communion of men having title to the Lords Supper muſt break bread, and drinck wine, to remember Chriſt, and shew forth his death till he come: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas you hold and teach, that the whole bundel of the Antichriſtian conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, miniſterie, worship, and Government of the aſſemblies are the Lords ordinances, you teach a falſe word: and whereas you being a falſe Church and Miniſtery, doe baptize with water, and break bread &amp; wine to remember a falſe Chriſt, and a falſe Teſtament, and a falſe Faith, therein you declare plainly that you have not the true Sacraments: and whereas in your (Obſerve well) you ſay, Truly and Rightly, reſpect grace in adminiſtring the VVord and Sacraments, and therefore to preach the word Truly, and Rightly to adminiſter the Sacraments, are no convertible ſignes of a true Church.

I confeſſe vnto you that the vſe of the Cenſures of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; excommunication which I ſuppoſe you cal diſcipline, is not a convertible ſigne of a true Church: but only powre &amp; title &amp; intereſt to vſe them: this title I deny you to have: For how can you being in your conſtitution mighled with the world, &amp; vnſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; poluted with ſo many Antichriſtian fornications as yet are extant in your aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, have title to any of the Lords ordinances: doth the Lord (think you) give his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant &amp; new Teſtament, purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt vnto ſuch perſons as trample vnder foot the whole Teſtament of Chriſt, &amp; the ordinances therof? hath the theef title to the true mans purſe though he have the poſſeſſion of it? no more have you title to Chr. viſibly though you vſurp him &amp; challendg him never ſo peremptorily: wherefor to end this point of the properties of the true Church I ſay til you have Seperated your ſelves from al the wicked people &amp; Antichriſtian ordinances in your aſſemblies, til you have vowed &amp; covenanted to embrace &amp; practiſe al the ordinances of Chriſts new Teſtament you can have no title or intereſt to the holy things of God: vſe them as long as you lift, you abuſe them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, to conclude this firſt part of the Section, viz: that your Churches are falſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: I ſay to that which you object, pag. 110. that many corruptions may be in a church, yet it a true Church the conſtitution being true, viz: So long as they are not impenitent after conviction: &amp; therfor Iſrael the Lords people ſo long as they retained their true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>The ſecond point to be handled in this Section, is, that al your miniſters are falſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: in handling whereof I wil proceed as in the former point of this Section, viz: Firſt, confirme the truth by arguments drawne from the Scriptures: Secondly, refute your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes wherby you would prove your miniſtery true.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the firſt place to prove your miniſters falſe Miniſters, I vſe theſe Arguments.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="argument">
                     <head>The firſt Argument.</head>
                     <p>The true miniſterie cannot be raiſed out of a falſe Church.</p>
                     <p>The Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England are falſe Churches.</p>
                     <p>Therfor the miniſters of thoſe aſſemblies Eccleſiaſtical are falſe miniſters.</p>
                     <p>The ground of this argument is propounded &amp; confirmed in the 7. Section, where it hath been proved by divers vndeniable reaſons that Chriſts miniſterial powre, whereof one
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3153:55"/>part is the calling of Miniſters, is not given by ſucceſſion to the Pope, Bbs. or presbytery, but to the body of the congregation, if they be but two or three: So that ſeing the true Church is in nature &amp; being before the miniſtery, &amp; the miniſterie is but one of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things given to the Church: one part of Chriſts powre delegated to the Church: one branch of that true title &amp; intereſt which the L. Ieſus the Bridegrome &amp; husband of the Church giveth to the Bride, the Spowſe of Chriſt, the true Church: The Miniſterie therfor muſt needes follow the Church, be after the Church, be raiſed out of the church: &amp; therefore the true Miniſtery of Chriſt is only where the true Church of Chriſt is, &amp; ſo it cannot be in the aſtemblies Eccleſiaſtical of England, being not the true Churches of Chriſt.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="argument">
                     <head>The ſecond Argument.</head>
                     <p>The true miniſterie hath a true office, in execution wherof it is exerciſed: Rom. 12.7 1. Cor. 12.5.28. Fph 4.11.</p>
                     <p>The miniſterie of the Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England have not a true office, in execution wherof it is exerciſed.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, The miniſterie of the Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England is not the true miniſterie.</p>
                     <p>The foundacion of this argument is this: viz: that ſeing the miniſterie of the Church of England ariſeth out of the miniſterie of the Church of Rome, as a branch out of the root of the tree, therfor it muſt needes be of the ſame nature &amp; kind with the miniſterie of the Church of Rome: For as a man begetteth a man, one light commeth of another, one Preiſt begetteth another in the old Teſtament, ſo in ordination by ſucceſſion, one Miniſter maketh another: &amp; therfor, as the branch is of the ſame nature with the root, the Sonne with the Father, one candle light with another, one Aaronical Preiſt with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: So muſt the miniſter ordeyned be of the ſame nature &amp; office with him that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyneth him: Seing therfor the miniſterie of the Church of Rome is a popish Sacrificing Preiſthood, that is a falſe miniſterie, having a falſe office: it muſt needes follow that the miniſterie of the Church of England proceeding from the miniſterie of the Church of Rome, as one light is inflamed of another, is of the ſame nature &amp; office, &amp; therfor a falſe miniſterie: neither can it ſuffice to ſay, that (as it is moſt true &amp; I do willingly confeſſe) the miniſterie of England is much Refined &amp; Reformed from the droſſe of popery: For Refine Sugar as long as you wil, it is Sugar ſtil in nature: Refine light as oft as you pleaſe, from brimſtone light to a tallow light, from tallow to Roſen, from Roſen to wax, from wax to Venice Turpentine, from that to the moſt pretious ſubject that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, yet the light is of the ſame nature with the brimſtone light: So Refine the miniſtery by Succeſſion of ordination as long &amp; as oft as you wil, yet it is ſtil of the firſt nature: &amp; til it be Refined to nothing, that is, til it be aboliſhed &amp; extinguished, a true miniſterie can never be raiſed vp againe: For who can bring a cleane thing out of that which is vncleane?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="argument">
                     <head>The third Argument.</head>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:3153:56"/>
                     <p>The true miniſterie hath a true vocation &amp; calling, by election, approbation, &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of that faithful people wher he is to adminiſter.</p>
                     <p>The miniſtery of the Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England, hath not the true vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; calling, by election, approbation, &amp; ordination of a faithful people where thy doe adminiſter.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, the miniſtery of the Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England is not the true mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which Chriſt hath placed in his Church.</p>
                     <p>The Major or firſt part of this argument is evident by theſe Scriptures compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Act. 6.2-6. and 14.23. 1. Timoth. 3.10. and 4.14. alſo it is evident by that which was obſerved, proved, and anſwered, concerning the ſeaventh Section of this Lettre.</p>
                     <p>The Minor or ſecond part of the argument is evident in it ſelf: For it is apparant that the miniſtery of England is called by Succeſſive ordination made by a Prelate &amp; his chaplin, in his owne chappel, with Subſcription to the abhominations of Antichriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in the 3. articles, with the oath of Canonical obedience to the Antichriſtian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy their Spiritual LL. &amp; juriſdiction, courts, &amp; canons: by giving the holy Ghoſt, apish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; blaſphemouſly abuſing the words of Chriſt, Ioh. 20.22.23. giving therby to the Preiſt ordeyned, powre to remit &amp; retayne ſinnes, which Chriſt hath given only to the body of the Church, &amp; not to the miniſters by Succeſſive ordination, as Sacrificing powre was propagated by Genealogie in the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from Preiſt to Preiſt: then the preiſt thus ordeyned is inforced vppon a parish, with the Patrons preſentation, &amp; the Lord B. his inſtitution, &amp; the Archdeacons induction, &amp; his owne tolling of a bell, &amp; taking hold of the Ring of the Church do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The next point to be handled is the answering of your objections, reaſons, &amp; cavils which you bring againſt this doctryne which we teach, &amp; for the ratefying of your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery to be true, &amp; I tel you Mr. Bern. you had need bring good ground, or els you &amp; your Fellow miniſters wilbe found Falſe Prophets, Theeves, and Robbers. Math. 7.15. Iohn. 10.1.</p>
                     <p>That which you alledg for your ſelves is conteyned from the pag. 128-146. of your book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt point wherof is this that (you ſay) your miniſtery is true bicauſe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Soules: <hi>I</hi> answer two things, 1. that you convert no man to that true viſible faith taught in the new Teſtament of Chriſt, wherby mans converſion muſt be judged: but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3153:56"/>you do pervert men from it dayly: as evident experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth: For your books againſt the Seperation, your preaching &amp; Sermons againſt the way of the Lord, your conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; diſputations, &amp; perswaſions, for men to forſake the truth, &amp; to continue ſtil with you in the communion of your Antichriſtian abhominations, or having forſaken you to returne back againe into Egipt, theſe &amp; the like courſes of yours moſt frequent to the beſt Reformiſts of the land plainly manifeſt that you convert none at all to the faith of Chriſts new Teſtament, but you pervert al that you poſſibly can from the ſame: Now what you do in ſecreat betwixt the L. &amp; the ſoules of them that heare you, he only that ſeeth in ſecreat knoweth in particular: particularly &amp; certainly we know not nor enquire not: See more of this point in that which is written before &amp; in the lettre to Mr. S. at the end of this book, 2. let it be granted that you do convert me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> even to the true viſible faith of the new Teſtament, I ſay this is no proor ſufficient of the truth of your miniſtery, that is to ſay, that you are thoſe true Paſtors mentioned, Eph. 4.11. Act. 20.28. 1. Pet. 5.1-3.1. Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.6-9 For theſe officers were give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the true church: which Church was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablished befor theſe officers were, &amp; theſe officers were occupied about the feding, that is teaching &amp; guiding of thoſe particular Churches wherto they attended: the Churches therfor conſiſting of Saints already converted to the faith of the new Teſtament, how doth converſion argue a true miniſterie of Paſtor, or Elder, or Bb. which converteth not as his proper work, but only feedeth, that is edifieth &amp; buildeth vp men converted, by teaching &amp; guiding them in the wayes of the Lord? See more of this point alſo in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. S. at the latter end of this book: &amp; in that which is written before which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>but heer you object that the Apoſtle, that is, one ſent proveth his calling by the ſeale of his miniſterie, viz. converſion: ſee: Rom. 4.14.15. 1. Cor. 9.2. &amp; 2. Cor. 3.1-3. &amp; 13.3.5. &amp; that it cannot be proved that Ieſus Chr. doth worke by falſe meanes, &amp; it is our owne grant. I answer that if your argument be framed into forme it is this.</p>
                     <p>He that converteth Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Miniſters of England convert Soules.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, the miniſters of England are Apoſtles as Paul: or thus.</p>
                     <p>He that converteth Soules is ſent of God. Rom. 10.14.15.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſters of England convert Soules.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, the miniſters of England are ſent of God.</p>
                     <p>If I should yeeld your firſt argument the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it would follow that you &amp; al the miniſters that convert ſoules in England are Ap. but you intend not to prove your ſelves Apſt: but ordinary Paſtors of viſible churches: &amp; therfore your argument if it were yeelded pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not your purpoſe: &amp; I know you do not challendg to be an Apoſtle as Paul was.</p>
                     <p>Againe to answer to your ſecond argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we yeeld you that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vert to the true ſaith of Chr. new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which is viſible, except he be ſent of God: but ſeing you pervert men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the new teſtament of Chr. (as I have proved) how can you herby prove your ſelves to be ſent of God? nay I ſay you are the inſtruments of Sathan ſent by the L. in his wrath to keep the people in bondage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obedience of the faith taught in the new teſtament: I do not determine what you are inviſibly, ſecreatly known to the L. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Scripture teach vs ſo to judg of faith: For how can the Scripture teach vs viſiblie to judg an inviſible thing which is not appearing in viſible Fruites?</p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:3153:57"/>
                     <p> Further wher as you ſay that the 1. Cor. 9.1. &amp; 2. Cor. 3.1-3. doth not intend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church of the Corinths, &amp; other Churches: but their converſion from idolatry to embrace the doctryne of the goſpel by faith: I anſwer that theſe two things which you diſtinguish are al one, &amp; they are no other in diſtinction then Arons beard, &amp; the beard of Aaron (as you ſpeake): for to convert men to the Faith of the goſpel, is to convert men to the true conſtituted. Church of Chriſt: For they are not converted to the true faith til they be converted &amp; eſtablished into the true Church if it may be ſound: So that this objection of yours is very inſufficient if not altogether ridiculous: &amp; for the force of the Apoſtles argument in theſe two places of the Corinths, I ſay it is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by you vtterly, &amp; ſo wreſted from the Holy Ghoſts purpoſe, &amp; miſapplyed by you to prove your intention. For the ſeale of Pauls Apoſtles hip was the Church of the Corinths converted to the ſaith, &amp; eſtablished into the true conſtitution of the new Teſtament 1. Cor. 9.2. &amp; ſo Paul expoundeth himſelf in the other place 2. Cor. 3.10. ſaying, that he was made an able Miniſter of the new Teſtament, even as Moſes was of the old: For the vnderſtanding of which place &amp; the whole matter, you muſt remember what Moſes did to the Church of the Iewes, &amp; what Paul did to the Church of the Corinths: Moſes did conſtitute the Church of the Iewes, according to the paterne shewed him in the mount &amp; that moſt faithfully, Heb. 8.5. Paul being the Apoſtle of the Gentils ſent by Chr. Ieſus for that purpoſe, hath eſtablished the Church of the Corinths, according to that paterne which Chriſt the Mediator revealed vnto him: which none could doe but an Apoſtle ſent by Chriſt: So that the force of Pauls Argument to prove himſelf an Apoſtle muſt thus be propounded &amp; conceaved.</p>
                     <p>He that hath the ſeale of an Apoſtelship is an Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>Paul hath the ſeale of an Apoſtelship, viz: an infallible direction from Chriſt Ieſus by the Spirit to convert &amp; eſtablish the Church of the Corinths into the true conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the new Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Ergo: Paul is an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now Mr. Bern.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3153:57"/>of the Land? wee appeale vnto your conſciences if you in our miniſtery have not felt the powre of the word to your inward converſion: If this be ſo: how can you forſake your Fathers that begat you? how can you go to the Seperation that never co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted you? &amp;c. I answer what you doe inwardly in converſion, I diſpute not, &amp; the Scripture regardeth not: what you doe outwardly that <hi>I</hi> plead, &amp; the Scripture diſcovereth: you convert not a man to the true faith of Chriſt which is viſible in the viſible communion of the true Church of the Apoſtle Pauls conſtitution ſuch as was the Church of the Corinths: and therfor you cannot by your inward inviſible converſion (which you plead for) prove your miniſtery: For except you can produce ſuch an effect as Paul did in the Corinths you cannot prove your ſelves to be the true miniſters that are ſent of God. For Paul ſaith yee Corinths are our Epiſtle vnderſtood &amp; read of al men: So that Pauls Seale of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery was an outward viſible, legible faith, viz: The faith of the true Church of the new Teſtament whereinto the Apoſtle had eſtablished them, which al men did ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, &amp; read manifeſtly: wherefore if you the Miniſters of England wil prove your ſelves to be the true miniſters of the new Teſament, then shew mee ſuch a ſeale of your mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery as the Apoſtle heere ſpeaketh of: convert men, &amp; eſtablish them in the true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Church of the primitive inſtitution, &amp; I for my part wil yeeld vnto you, that as paul was ſent extraordinarily, ſo are you ordinarily by the Lord, &amp; you are the true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Ieſus Chriſt truly ſent: Rom. 10. but ſeing you doe what you can to hinder al your diſciples from the true Corinthian Church eſtablished by paull according to the paterne of Chriſts new Teſtament, not bringing the people that depend vppon you ſo far as you know &amp; acknowledg, but ſtil counſel them to ſtay &amp; wayt for a better tyme, til the civil Magiſtrate wil give his allowance, vnder theſe pretences ſtil keeping them in Spiritual boundage to the abhominations of Antichriſt retayned in the Land: I ſay herby you manifeſtly diſcover vnto al the world, that ſeing you know the wil of your Lord &amp; Mr. Chriſt, &amp; doe it not, you are worthy to be beaten with many ſtripes: that ſeing you break the commaundements of Chriſt &amp; teach men ſo, you are the leaſt (that is none) in the Kingdome of Heaven: practiſing flat contrary to the Apoſtles who thought it better to obey God then man &amp; yet the Magiſtrates that forbad them were the Magiſtrates of the true Church of the Iewes: wherefore breefly to answer both Miniſters &amp; profeſſors: To the profeſſors I ſay: Shew mee your faith by embracing the whole new Teſtament of Chriſt. To the miniſters I ſay: Shew mee the Seale of your miniſtery by converting &amp; eſtablishing a Church after the Apoſtolique Corinthian frame &amp; conſtitution: &amp; I wil grant that then you are true miniſters, &amp; your diſciples truly converted: in the meane tyme I wil judg your viſible ſtanding in Chriſtianity as it is viſible: &amp; your invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible being in Chriſtianity <hi>I</hi> wil leave to the Lord, who ſeeth in ſecreat, &amp; who knoweth who are his not doubting but the Lord hath his thouſands even in the depth of popery much more among you: &amp; this is that Mr. Bern. which wee hold &amp; grant concerning this point.</p>

Thus were al the Diſciples of Iohn &amp; of Chriſt converted, of this converſion &amp; Faith muſt the places of the Evangeliſts be vnderſtood: as namely that Ioh. 4.39. &amp; others: ſo were the Iewes, Proſelites, &amp; ſome of Samaria converted, for as yet Chr. was not preached to the Gentils, which he himſelf for bad to be done, Mat. 10. thus were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> converted to beleve that the Meſſias which they knew should come, was come, &amp; that Ieſus the Sonne of God, &amp; the Sonne of Mary was hee: who vppon their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; baptisme became Chriſts Diſciples to learne &amp; practiſe whatſoever he should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward teach them: That this is ſo read, Act. 18, 23. &amp; 19.2.3.

So that Iohn converted men to the Faith of Chriſt to be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: after the day of Pentecoſt, the Apoſtles converted men to the Faith of Chriſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given &amp; exhibited: Seing therfor that the new Teſtament of Chriſt is now confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; eſtablished, &amp; revealed manifeſtly in the Scriptures of the Apoſtles of our Lord, al that are converted now are converted to the new Teſtament &amp; the ordinances there of, or els they are not converted to vs viſiblie: This being thus premiſed as neceſſarily to be vnderſtood for the true knowledg of true converſion: in the next place we muſt take notice (for the answering of the objection of private mens converting) that Antichriſt hath defaced the Faith of Chriſt in the whole new Teſtament, &amp; ſo the true miniſtery: &amp; therfor it muſt needes be that whoſoever doth convert from Antichriſtianisme, &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablisheth a people into the true Faith &amp; new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt performeth that work either as a miniſter of Antichriſt: or as an Apoſtle, Prophet, Evangeliſt of Chriſt: or as a Private perſon: For this is a ſufficient enumeration of parts ther being no other ſort off perſons to convert men from Antichriſt to Chriſt but one of theſe: For you have heard that Paſtors do not convert but feed the flock: I ſuppoſe you dare not a vouch that the Miniſters off Antichriſt do convert to the true Faith &amp; new Teſtament off Chriſt Ieſus: neither dare you ſay that ther are now in the world the offices of Apoſtles, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts: wherfor when men convert they do it as private perſons: Therfore chooſe Mr. Bern. which of theſe three you wil affirme: &amp; then tel mee whither private perſons doe not convert, as Act. 11.19-21. &amp; this shal ſuffice for this point, of converting performed by private perſons in the riſing vp from the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt, &amp; for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your objection &amp; answer.</p>
                     <p>Now from the pa. 130-141. you teach vs the doctryne of the vocation of miniſters which I wil not altogether disalow, nor approve wholly: &amp; ſeing it aperteyneth not to our queſtion, I leave it wholy vntoucht: &amp; come to that which is pa. 141-146. wher you endevour againe to prove your miniſtery true, &amp; that after this manner.</p>
                     <p>They that are called of Chriſt, having both gifts &amp; graces: they that are alſo outward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly caled of the church being examined, aproved, elected, ordeyned: they that preach true doctrine, adminiſter the true Sacraments, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:3153:58"/>
                     <p> The miniſters of the Church of England have al theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, the miniſters of the Church of England are the true miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I answer you Mr. Ber. that the Popish miniſters have al theſe forſaid qualifications in common with the miniſters of England, (I plead not of the degree or meaſure of theſe things, for I confeſſe ſome of them to be much more in the English miniſters but I ſpeake of the kind or nature of the qualifications): which I prove by induction thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Popish miniſters many of them have excellent outward gifts &amp; graces asmuch learning, vtterance, zeale, &amp; gravity as any miniſters of England, though al of them have not ſo: as al the miniſters of England have not ſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Popish ministers are called examined, aproved, elected, ordeyned of the Church, (that is as you expound, the cheef governors, who are as true ministers as you are, ſeing your miniſtery is a branch of the roote): So are you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Popish miniſters preach the true doctryne of Chriſt, &amp; adminiſter his true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: for you retaine the baptiſme that men have in popery as true, and they breake and eate bread and wine in remembrance of Chriſts death: &amp; although you preach more truth then they do, &amp; adminiſter baptiſme &amp; the L. Supper more purely, or rather leſſe corruptly, yet they have the ſame truths &amp; Sacraments that you have, even the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, baptizme &amp; the L. Supper.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Popish miniſters many of them performe their office Faithfully in many things as Faithfully as you do: &amp; the beſt you do not performe al the parts of the true mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, &amp; the worſt of you are as bad as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he worſt popish preiſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The popish miniſters ſome of them live conſcionably according to their rule, the beſt of you do no more: &amp; the worſt of you are as vild beaſts as the groſſeſt shavelings in Rome.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As the Popish miniſters convert none viſibly to the true Faith and new Teſtament of Chriſt, &amp; vet I doubt not but that thouſands are by them converted &amp; ſaved (what Mr. Be. wil you condemne al the men that have lived from Gregory the great til the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cel of Conſtance, &amp; to this day vnder the dominions of the pope? For shame do not ſo.) So though the forwardeſt miniſters of England convert many inviſibly to life &amp; Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, yet you ordinarily ſay, that the Formaliſts convert none, &amp; the dumb mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters cannot convert, bicauſe they cannot preach: &amp; none of you al convert a man viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the true Faith taught in the new Teſtament of Chriſt, but with al your might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert men from it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Finally, the popish miniſters are approved by their people, aswel as the beſt or worſt of you are, according to the dispoſitions of the people.</p>
                     <p>Seing therfor that al theſe things are as evident &amp; pregnant for the popish miniſters as for you, therfor either they are true miniſters if you be true: or els bicauſe they are fals (as you ſay) &amp; yet have al theſe forſaid qualifications, therfor theſe qualifications make not a true miniſtery: So that you ſee Mr. Ber. that you argument is weak to prove your miniſtery true, &amp; you muſt ſeek out a better definition of a true miniſtery, &amp; according therto shape your miniſtery, if you wil have it true.</p>
                     <p>In the next place you with an objection &amp; answer would prove that although your miniſters have a falſe entrance, viz: ordination of the Bb. yet may be true miniſters: &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely by two reaſons, 1. For that none were ever ordeyned but by eccleſiaſtical perſons,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3153:59"/>as Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Bbs. 2. a falſe entrance cannot make a falſe miniſtery, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                     <p>I answer: Firſt, if it were yeelded you that ther could be no true miniſters made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ordination of Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Bbs. yet bicauſe your L. Bbs. are not thoſe true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Evangeliſts, Bbs. of the primitive inſtitution, but rather the Servants of Antichriſt, (as your forwardeſt profeſſors &amp; preachers inſtantly affirme) therefore ther ordination is Antichriſtian, and ſo your miniſtery is falſe in the entrance: but Secondly, I deny it to be true which you affirme for ordination by procedent Elders: For I have proved vnto you by many vndeniable reaſons that the whole miniſteriall powre of Chriſt is given to the body of the Church, whereby, as in the firſt conſtituting of Churches, ſo in the riſing of Churches from Antichriſtianisme, the body hath powre to al the Holy ordinances of Chriſt for ther mutual edification to life &amp; Salvation, whereof the true miniſtery is a principal: &amp; therefore the Church hath powre to enjoy the true miniſtery: &amp; you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Church wanting officers hath powre to elect her officers, which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, Act. 6. &amp; 14. &amp; why not to approve &amp; ordeyne which are but the inferior &amp; leſſe principal? Further, you may read Act. 1. that before ther were any Apoſtles actually in of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice, the Church did choſe Mathias into the rome of Iudas, &amp; that by a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſent: wherfor this firſt exception of yours is nothing.</p>
                     <p>Your Second exception is as weake: that ſeing a faulty entrance into mariage which is one ordinance of God, doth not disanul it, why should a faulty entrance into the mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtery disanul it? I ſay the violating of accidental circumſtances through ignorance shall not disanul any of Gods ordinances: For then their should be no true having of any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God whatſoever: Seing it is impoſſible wee should perfectly &amp; ſtrictly keep all &amp; every circumſtance therto aperteyning: but the wilful breach of eſſential parts of the ordinance doth corrupt the ordinance &amp; make it falſe: as for example: The matter or forme being falſe, the ordinance cannot poſſible be true: A man marieth a mayde that is 6. yeer old: or a woman marieth an Evnuch: the mariage is falſe, for the matter is falſe: A man taketh a woman not as his wife, but as a concubine, as the yonger brethren the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Venice doe, this is no true mariage, bicauſe it wanteth the true forme of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: ſo your Churches aſſume them miniſters, ſuppoſe they be the true paſtors deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the word, as I am perswaded your Puritanes ſo endevour, I ſay bicauſe your chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies are falſe, your miniſtery is not true: For a true Miniſter &amp; a falſe Church cannot mary together: Further, if your Church &amp; miniſtery were true, yet if you should be preſented by a Patron, ordeyned by a Prelate, inducted by an Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, contrary to the wil of the Church, the mariage is falſe, bicauſe the calling is falſe: So then you ſee Mr. Ber. how litle your ſimilies help you wherein notwithſtanding you by your diſciples are thought Specialy to excel, and to have the prehemenence over your fellow Preiſts.</p>
                     <p>And heer you bring a flourish out of the 10. of Iohn to prove your miniſters true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: what Mr. Bern. in good ſooth doe you plead this for all your Miniſters of England? Speak plainly &amp; double not with God &amp; man: doe you in your conſcience think that al the miniſters of England, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your dumb Preiſts (whome you have excluded by your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) your groſſe nonreſidents &amp; idle bellyes the Cathedral or Collegiate Preiſts, your double benificed men, that al theſe &amp; every one of them doe enter in by the dore? have

Lin. 7.8. you ſpeake warily: you ſay: The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of a true Shepheard agree wel with Miniſters in England: you dare not ſay with al the Miniſters of England: Therefore by your owne conſcience al the Miniſters of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are not true Shepheards: your Lords the Prelates wil con you litle thank for this: but let vs exclude your dumb Preiſts, idle bellyes, and al the rable of the conformiſts if you wil, which are 9. parts of 10. (and then I think you are excluded your ſelf among them:) I wil plead only againſt the beſt miniſter that ſtandeth by Law in your aſſemblies: 1. he entereth not in by the dore, ſeing the dore is only in the Sheepſold, that is in the true Church: &amp; ſeing you are a Falſe Church (as is proved) your dore cannot be true. 2. The porter (that is as you ſay Gods Spirit: but I think rather the porter to be the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is the whole Church, Mat. 13.33-37) he openeth not to you, for you convert none to the true viſible Faith of the new Teſtament, or if you did, it doth not prove your true Paſtorship, ſeing Shepheards do not make sheep, but feed them: it should only prove that you are Spiritual Fathers that convert men which private perſons doe as you have heard, 3. he doth not know them nor is knowne of his Sheep: For of 300 perhaps he wil not acknowledg above 30. to be sheep, the reſt he thinketh goates, &amp; the goates wil not acknowledg him as Shepheard, but hate &amp; fly from him. 4. he doth not lead them by ſound doctryne to perfection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, but by Falſe doctryne perverteth them from the truth, which blaſphemouſly he proclaymeth dayly in his pulpit to be Browniſme, Schiſme, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, &amp;c. 5. he doth not lead them by Godly life, for if the cheef part of Godlines be the true worship of God, how doth he lead them in Godlines, that leadeth them vp &amp; downe in your Falſe Church, Miniſtery, VVorship, &amp; Government, blind fold like the men of Sodom that ſought Lots dore: Therefore I dare in the true feare of the Lord cal the beſt of you al a Spiritual theef, &amp; a robber, yea a VVolf that cometh to kil, rob, and deſtroy: not that you ſo entend to doe: or that you do ſo wilfully, (&amp; yet I would have you Mr. Bern. Look wel to your ſelf, for I dare not cleare you from ſinninge againſt your conſcience, who have acknowledged the truth:) but for that you do ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, &amp; by neceſſary conſequent: For ſeing you are in a Falſe Church, &amp; Miniſtery, and vſe a Falſe worship, &amp; ſubmit to a Falſe Government, you muſt needes by defending al this Falſehood &amp; teaching it to others, &amp; perſwading them to the obedience therof, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwade them to al theſe abhominations of Antichriſt, &amp; ſo do rob them, kil them, &amp; raven them, like wolves, theeves, &amp; robbers: For men may rob, kil, &amp; deſtroy ignorantly, as Paul did when he was a Phariſee, as I my ſelf did when I was one of your Preiſts, &amp; as many do in popery, except you wil ſay that they al do ſinne againſt their conſcience, Act. 3.17. 1. Tim. 1.13.</p>
                     <p>And heer you have a fling at our miniſters, &amp; wil needes have them no Lawful mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: you dare not ſay falſe: &amp; this you endevour to prove bicauſe that we are not made Miniſters by Succeſſive ordination.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:3153:60"/>
                     <p> Firſt, Mr. Be. I tel you bicauſe of your importunity in this particular of ordination by Succeſſion that if it muſt needes be (which we deny vtterly) that we have it, if you have it, for we were made Preiſts by your prelates: why then do you condemne our miniſtery ſay you? why do you condemne the miniſtery of the Church of Rome ſay I? For if you may have a true miniſtery, &amp; yet condemne the miniſters of the Church of Rome, from whence yours came: then may we have a true miniſtery, &amp; yet condemne your miniſtery whence ours cometh: this I ſpeake, not for that <hi>I</hi> plead it, but to ſtop your mouth: For I vtterly renounce your orders which I had from Wicka<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prelate of Lincolne, when I was choſen Fellow of Chriſts College in Cambridg: &amp; I receaved &amp; doe retayne my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery from that particular Church wherof I am Paſtor: which hath the whole powre of Chriſt miniſteriall delegated to her from Chriſt her Husband, when he contracted with her.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you neieher can nor do prove Succeſſion in the new Teſtament: For that which you alledg for the Succeſſion of the old Teſtament, I ſay it was typical, &amp; is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Chriſt: For do you think this is a good argument: one Preiſt begat another in the old Teſtament, therfor one miniſter muſt ordeine another in the new Teſtament: why may you not plead after this manner: Therfor one Preiſt may beget another Preiſt in the new Teſtament? &amp; wheras you ſay that Preiſts did conſecrate preiſts, which conſecration was ther ordination, I deny it vtterly, &amp; I prove the contrary, that during the captivity of Babilon ther were many prieſts borne &amp; none conſecrated, only for their admiſſion in to the preiſts office it was requiſite that they should shew their Genealogie, Nehe. 7.64, 65. but their ordination was their generation or byrth: though <hi>I</hi> deny not but when they entered into the performance of their office ther were ſome rites performed which was no part of their ordination: but I would know of you what is ordination: is it any thing but the declaring of the partie elected &amp; approved to be in office, by prayer for him &amp; a chardg given vnto him? can none do this but a precedent officer? Againe, for the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament I ſay, God created the firſt Preiſt, viz: Adam, then til Aaron men begat Preiſts, for the eldeſt in the Family were the Preiſts: Moſes who was the yonger brother &amp; no preiſt ordeined Aaron &amp; his Sonnes: after that Preiſts begat preiſts til Chriſts tyme: then Chriſt appointed officers in the Church: Apoſtles made Evangeliſts, Evangeliſts &amp; Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned Bbs. &amp; Deacons: al this I confeſſe Mr. Ber. what is this to Succeſſion in the new Teſtament? I shew you plainly that the Church Elected Mathias, ther being yet no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Act. 1. ther being Apoſtles the Church elected Deacons, Act. 6. &amp; Elders, Act. 14. &amp; ſeing they performed election which is the contract, why may they not performe all? For ordination is nothing in reſpect of Election, as you may ſee in al Societyes &amp; corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations whatſoever: The contract which is the mutual conſent of a man &amp; woman for mariage maketh man and wife before God Election which is the mutual conſent of the paſtor &amp; his Flock, maketh a man paſtor of his Flock: So that in this particular Mr. Bern. you show your willfullnes and blindnes asmuch as in any thing in your book, although I doubt not, but it is the beſt that can be pleaded for Antichriſt: &amp; thus much for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of this Section.</p>
                     <p>The third part of this Section is, that your worship is a falſe worship wherin, as I have dealt in the two former points, ſo wil I deale in this, viz, firſt prove the poſition: Secondly answer your cavils.</p>

                     <p> To prove your worship a falſe worship I vſe theſe Arguments following.</p>

                  <div type="argument">
                     <head>Firſt Argument.</head>
                     <p>The true worship of the L. cannot poſſiblie be offered vp in a falſe Church.</p>
                     <p>The Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England are falſe Churches.</p>
                     <p>Ergo. The worship offered vnto the L. in thoſe Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies is a falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                     <p>The ground of this argument is this, that al the Eccleſiaſtical actions performed by a falſe Church are ſtayned with the falſe conſtitution of the church: For God wil not have every communion of men worship him, but he wilbe worshipped by ſuch a company of people as he hath deſcribed in his new Teſtament: &amp; as in the old Teſtament no man or company of men might worship or be accepted viſibly, but ſuch as were circumcized, Gen. 17.14. Exod. 12.48. Deut. 23.1-4. Act. 21.28. 2. King. 17.25-28. Ioh. 4.22. So in the new Teſtament no man or communion of men viſiblie can be accepted of the L. but ſuch as are deſcribed in the new Teſtament, viz. men Seperated from al the abhominations of Antichriſt, 2. Cor. 6.17. &amp; gathered into the name of Chriſt Ieſus, Mat. 18.20. &amp; being made Diſciples have receaved baptiſme whereby they are counited into Chriſt, Mat. 28.19. If any communion of men otherwiſe conſtituted (viz: men not Seperated, not gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, not gathered into Chriſts name, not made Diſciples, not baptized truely with the baptiſme of the new Teſtament,) if any ſuch company of men do worship God ther worship is not accepted of God: but as the L. ſent Lyons among the Samaritanes for perſuming to worship him in the land of Iſrael, they being an vncircumcized co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, 2. King 17.24.25. &amp; as the L. punished the vagabond Iewes, exorciſts by the violence of an evil Spirit, for naming the L. Ieſus being an vnbeleeving &amp; vnbaptized company, Act. 19.13-17. even ſo wil the L. be avenged on al them that joyning together to worship God, have not Seperated themſelves, or calling vppon the name of the Lord, do not depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniquity, 2. Cor. 6.17. 2. Tim. 2.19. neither wil it ſerve to ſay that the worship is true bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is true conceaved prayer, or true preaching, or thanksgiving: For true worship muſt be defined, not only in the matter, but cheefly in the forme: For otherwiſe among the Antichriſtian papiſts &amp; Heretiques ther is true conceaved prayer, preaching &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks giving. &amp; els in the old Teſtament ther was true Sacrificing among the Babylonians whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they Sacrificed an oxe to the God of Iſrael, Dan. 6.25.26. whereas it was manifeſted that no Sacrifice could be accepted that was offered with ſtraunge fire, Levit. 10.1.2. &amp; there for the Sacrifices of the Babylonians muſt needes be abhominable, though the matter was true, bicauſe the forme which cheefly conſiſted in the fire was falſe: So though the matter of the worship of the new Teſtament be true, viz: conceaved prayer, preaching, praiſing God, yet bicauſe it proceedeth not from the true fire which is alwayes living vppon the Altar, Levit. 6.9-13. at Ieruſalem, that is, in the true Church and Tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3153:61"/>may be inuiſibly I diſpute not: nor doe not cenſure at all, but leave to the Lord, and to every conſcience.</p>

                     <head>The Second Argument.</head>
                     <p>The worship that is offered vp vnto the L. by a falſe Miniſterie, is a falſe worship, &amp; ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not viſibly be judged true or accepted.</p>
                     <p>The worship of the Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of England is offered vp by a falſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: as hath been proved already.</p>

                     <p>The ground of this Argument is the ſame with the former: wherefore as in the old Teſtament the worship that was performed in Iſrael by the Preiſts of Ieroboams deviſing which were not of the Linage &amp; genealogie of Aaron was a falſe worship, &amp; could not be accepted viſibly, or be judged as accepted judging by the rules of the word. 1.

Chron. 26.16-22. and the King was punished with Leproſy for his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So al the worship which is offered vp vnto the Lord by a falſe miniſtery, is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be judged abhominable, bicauſe Chriſt only offered vp to his Father the worship of the worshippers which his new Teſtament hath deſcribed &amp; no other, Rev. 8.3.4. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Revel. 5.8-10. &amp; 11.1. ſtil let it be remembred that I diſpute not, nor cenſure not, the inviſible things of the Lord.</p>

                     <p>Iewish, that is literal, ſtinted, impoſed book-worship is falſe worship.</p>

                     <p>The ground of this argument is the Analogie and proportion which ther is betwixt the type and the truth, the shadow and the ſubſtance, the lettre and the Spirit, the Old Teſtament with the ordinances therof, &amp; the new Teſtament with the ordinances there of: For ſeing the old Teſtament was a type of the new, therfor the Church, miniſtery, worship, &amp; government of the old Teſtament were types of the Church, miniſtery, worship &amp; government of the new Teſtament, therfor the worship of the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being lyteral beginning in the lettre (as was carnal circumciſion Rom. 2.29.) did type forth the worship of the new Teſtament to beginne in the Spirit, Ioh. 4.23.24. For the Lettre was a type of the Spirit, Col. 2.17. Seing therfor that Reading the Law was a typical ordinance of the old Teſtament, &amp; therfor literal, ſtinted, manifeſting the letter, &amp; book-worship, it followeth that it is now abolished by Chriſt, &amp; the thing ſignified by the literal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is now to be retayned in the new teſtament, which is, vttering matter out of the hart, called the manifeſtation of the Spirit, the demonſtration of the Spirit, the miniſtring of the Spirit, &amp; the like: by which phraſes of Speech the Holy Ghoſt would teach vs, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3153:61"/>ſeing we are fet at liberty from the bondage of the law which was a Schoolmr. to leade to Chriſt, we are not therfor againe to be intangled with the yoke of bondage in any thing, no not in this matter of ſtinted, literal, book worship which is flat ludaiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that deſireth to know further of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of book-worship let him read the book lately published intituled: The differences of the Churches of the Seperation: wher this point is largely discuſſed, which if it be the truth I deſire may be embraced, if not. I require an answer of them to whom it is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally directed: to conclude this firſt point, Mr. Bern. ſeing your VVorship for the moſt part is book-worship, I conclude it to bee Iewish, and ſo falſe VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to answer your cavils which are conteyned pag. 146-151.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you referre vs to the treatiſe in the end of your book, &amp; I referre you for answer partly to Mr. Ains. partly to the book intituled the differences of the Churches of the Seperation: For I doe acknowledg that in the Old Teſtament, Pſalmes, Prayers, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were read out of a book: &amp; yet further I answer three things: 1. that it will not follow that ſeing it was ſo in the old Teſtament, therfor it muſt be ſo in the new: nay con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary: it was ſo in the old Teſtament, therefore it muſt not be ſo in the new: This is the true manner of reaſoning: or thus: In the Old Teſtament they had Pſalmes, Prophecyes, Prayers, read out of a book, which was the Type, the manifeſtation of the Lettre: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the new Teſtament, wee muſt have Pſalmes, Prophecyes, Prayers, brought out of the hart, which is the Spiritual book of the New Teſtament, wherein the Lord doth write his Lawes, Heb. 8.10. which is the truth, the manifeſtation of the Spirit, 2. it will not follow that if it were granted that reading the Prayers, Prophecyes, &amp; Pſalmes of Scripture out of the Originall tongs the Hebrue and Greek, were lawfull, that therefore the reading of the Apocrypha tranſlations which are the workes of men is Lawful: For theone is interpretation of a Language or Tong, that is the vttering of matter from the knowledg of the Tongs and the gift of interpreting: the other is reading wordes out of a book, which a child of eight yeeres old may doe. 3. neither will it follow that if it were found lawfull to read the English tranſlation of the Scriptures, therefore it shalbe lawful to read your English Maſſe-book, your book of Homilies, and Articles your book of Canons: For then why may you not read alſo Mr. Perkins vppon the Creed, Henry Smyths Sermons, or any other good Catechiſme, Commentary, or Sermon book?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you prove your worship true by two reaſons, 1. Say you, you worship no Falſe God. 2. you worship the true God with no Falſe worship: For you preach the true word, admiſter the true Sacraments, pray ſuch prayers as are agreeable to the Scripture, &amp; the forme of prayer taught by Chriſt: &amp; if any things els be preſcribed, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as worship: Or if it were preſcribed as a part of worship, it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that all the worship is Falſe: well: I answer: That Iſraell in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toboams tyme and after, and when Aaron made the Calfe, did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3153:62"/>worship a falſe God, &amp; yet their worship was falſe: So may your worship be falſe though you worship the true God that hath revealed himſelf in the old Teſtament: but their worship is not true by your owne confeſſion: therfor your conſequent is not good that ſeing you worship the true God, your worship muſt needes be true: if the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by you worship be a falſe meanes deviſed by the wit of a man &amp; not taught in the word of God, I ſay your worship is falſe: &amp; ſo that place of Mat. 15.1. importeth that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worshippeth God by any invented meanes, taught by mans precept worshippeth God invayne: Such is an image as the ſecond commaundement teacheth: now the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your worship are falſe, as firſt your falſe Church which is an Idol. 2. your ſtinted deviſed, impoſed, literal ſervice book, which is an Idol, 3. your falſe Chriſt which is not your King, Preiſt, &amp; Prophet, which is one of our Idols: For though you truly beleeve concerning his perſon, yet your Faith is falſe, &amp; your doctryne falſe concerning his offices &amp; mediation: &amp; therfor theſe meanes of your worship being falſe meanes, they muſt needes be falſe worship: therfor, ſeing your doctryne is much of it falſe: your communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſe: your worship ſtinted &amp; book worship: it followeth that your word is not the true word, your Sacraments the ſignes of your falſe Faith &amp; communion are not true: your prayers are not true: &amp; whereas you plead that other things beſides the word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; prayer, are not impoſed as worship, I answer: what doe they then in your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? wil you mingle that which is no worshis, &amp; worship together? either they are wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship, or els let them be caſt out of your worship: &amp; further, whereas you alledg that though ſome parts of your worship he falſe, yet al shal not be falſe, I grant it, if your Church were true, &amp; your miniſtery true: but ſeing your Church &amp; miniſtery be falſe, therfor though you do preach the true word, &amp; adminiſter the true Sacraments, &amp; pray true prayers, yet they can not be true worship offered vp in a falſe Church, by a falſe miniſtery, for the falſehood of the Church &amp; miniſtery doth eſſentially corupt the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: if al that is ſet vppon the table be either poiſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or poyſoned meate, I ſay ſuch is your worship: For death is in your worship, as Coloquintida was in the pot: So that you ſee the diſtinction of true &amp; falſe doth moſt properly aperteyne to your worship: as it doth alſo to your miniſtery &amp; Church, as hath been shewed.</p>
                     <p>In the next place you declare vnto vs out of Philip Mornaeus the order of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the old Teſtament, &amp; out of the Scripture the parts of the worship of the new Teſtament, &amp; out of Iuſtinus Martyr the order of worship in his tymes, which I wil not contradict, &amp; yet I plead, that ſeing your Church is falſe, your miniſtery falſe, your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice book a falſe meanes of worship, therfor though al that you alledg were true, it doth not follow that your worship is true: &amp; wheras you plead that reading, Col. 4.16. is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded as a part of worship, I wish you to read the book intituled the differences of the Churches of the Seperation, &amp; you shall have your answer: and thus much for this Section.</p>

                  <p> Further, pag. 152. Mr. Bern. accounteth this one of our errors, to hold that None of the Miniſters of England may be heard: and pag. 155. He reckeneth this as another of our errors, to deſend it to be vnlawfull to joyne in praver with any of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Seing the aſſemblies Eccleſiaſtical are falſe Churches, and the members of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies members of falſe Churches, how can the members of true Churches have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them in that eſtate and ſtanding. For Chriſt and Antichriſt, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and the members of the ſtrumpet cannot bee mingled together, and as it is impoſſible that oyle &amp; waters should mingle, ſo cannot the body of Chriſt and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt the members of the one body and of the other be made one: Braſſe, Iron, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gold, cannot poſſibly be mingled with clay or earth: No more can the members of the true Church, and the members of the falſe Church: but in al the parts of Spirituall communion, as prayer, prophecy, prayſing God, the Sacraments, the perſons that partake in them are commingled, &amp; make one body. 1. Cor. 5.9.11.2. Theſ. 3.14. 1. Cor. 10.15.17 &amp; 2. Cor. 6.14-18. Therfor whoſoever shal mingle with falſe miniſters or members of falſe Churches therin offer as shameful indignity to Chriſt, as it is to take the members of Chriſt, &amp; make them the members of an harlot. 1. Cor. 6.15.</p>
                  <p>And heer Mr. Bern. pag. 153-156. indevoureth to prove it, 1. Lawfull to heare their Miniſters, 2. to be vnlawfull to heare vs, 3. to be lawfull to pray with them that are Faithful among them: For the firſt you ſay, who ever heard, that to heare the word should be a ſinne? yes: I have heard it in theſe places of Scripture, Deut. 13.3 Math. 7.15. 1. Timoth. 6.3-5. &amp; 2.3.5-6. againe you ſay: you have converted by the word, go: you may bee heard: I deny that ever you converted men viſibly to the Faith of the New Teſtament, I regard not what you doe inviſibly, for I cannot ſee it nor know it: what ſay you to them that convert in popery, shal they be heard? or doe you think they convert none inviſibly? Viſibly I am aſſured they convert not: the like I ſay of you. Further you plead that the Scripture commaundeth to heare the word, pronounceth them bleſſed that heare it, and maketh it a marke of Gods Child ſo to doe: I grant it, if it be preached in the Lords true ordinance, els men are forbidden to heare it, pronounced accurſed that heare it, and are marked for the Servants of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt for ſo doeing, Revellat. 14.9-11. Moreover you ſay, Chriſt forbiddeth not to heare the Scribes and Phariſees: true, for they were members of the true Church of the Old Teſtament, and their communion Typical was not polluted by Typicall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes for ought that is mentioned to my knowledg: but you ſay Paull rejoyced that Chriſt was preached, though of contention &amp; with a purpoſe to encreaſe his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Well: Paull rejoyced not that falſe Miniſters in falſe Churches preached Chriſt, or that Chriſtians heard them ſo doe: neyther doth Paull ſpeak of viſible ſinnes, but of inviſible affections, which he by the Spiritt diſcerned to bee in the Teachers, even as Peter diſcerned Ananias and Sapphyras diſſembling: And what is this to your purpoſe who are both falſe Miniſters in falſe Churches, &amp; Antichriſtian convinced Heretiques, except you can and doe make answer, which when you have done, then, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For the Second, you ſay wee are not to bee heard, bicauſe (as Browniſts) wee ſpeake our owne fantaſies, &amp; viſions of our owne harts, and are obſtinate
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3153:64"/>Wel Mr. Bern. I ſay no more for this point, but this, that every Godly mynded man give ſentence whither you or wee have the truth: the tyme wil come when ſecret things will come to light: &amp; your ſelves doe approve al that wee profeſſe in ſubſtance except the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration: the Lord judg betwixt you &amp; vs: you ſay againe, that wee convert none but are our ſelves converted by you: I ſay al that come from you to vs are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by vs converted to the truth from your errors &amp; falſe wayes, &amp; you doe not convert one man viſibly to the faith: Beſides I demaund when you Seperated from Rome, who converted you from Rome? Finally, wee condemne no man among you, only wee declare what you are viſibly in the account of the Scriptures, by reaſon of your falſe Church, &amp; ſtanding: &amp; they that ſee the truth to be the truth &amp; yeeld not to it woe be vnto them: &amp; take heed you be not of them who have ſeen it to be the truth, &amp; have confeſſed it ſo to be, &amp; yet write your bookes againſt it: if it be ſo, woe be vnto you from the Lord: I ſay from the Lord except you repent you shal grow worſe and worſe: as for them that ſinne through ignorance, their is a Sacrifice for their ſinnes: Lett willfull ſcorners looke to them ſelves.</p>
                  <p>For the third, you ſay, that if wee hold you the children of God wee may pray with you: For ſo Chriſt hath taught vs to ſay our Father: Well: I deny not but thoſe among you that apertayne to the Lords Election have God for their Father, but I ſay they are in viſible, vnknowne to vs certainly &amp; particularly, therefore wee cannot have viſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them: For whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne: I may have viſible communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with one that is a reprobate in the Lords account, as Peter had with Iudas: &amp; I may not have viſible communion with one that is Elect in the Lords inviſible Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe he is not viſibly faithful to me, as namely with thouſands of you in the aſſemblies, bicauſe I cannot poſſibly know them certainly, &amp; particularly.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Ber. Sep. Schiſme, pag. 151. Saith that this is one of our errors to hold: That our congregations as they ſtand, are all &amp; every of them vncapable before God to chuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Miniſters, though they deſire the meanes of Salvation,</p>

                  <p>Heer I deſire that it may be obſerved that I doe not deny, but men that are mixt may apoint one to preach the word vnto them: but that which I ſay, is, that a mixt company of good &amp; bad is not a true Church: &amp; that a man choſen by them to be their Miniſter, is not a true miniſter: If men deſire inſtruction I deny not, but they may appoint one to teach them, &amp; that Magiſtrates in ther dominions may appoint men to preach the word to ther ſubjects for ther converſion, &amp; that it is a lawful thing, for the people to heare ſuch men, &amp; for men of gifts to preach to ſuch a people, this we ſee practiſed Act. 13.42. &amp; 17.19-21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 28.30. &amp; otherwiſe how is it poſſible that men should be brought to the knowledg of the truth &amp; Mr. Ber. if you think that we deny the lawfulnes of this, you doe vs open wrong: &amp; if his Matie. should diſſolve the parish Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies &amp; the falſe miniſtery, &amp; should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund men of knowledg &amp; gifts to preach the word to his ſubjects, I doubt not, but al of vs would herein readily yeeld our ſelves to heare &amp; learne the truth at any ſuch perſons, &amp; ourſelves to teach the truth to ſuch a people: but to ſay that ſuch a people are true Churches, or ſuch preachers the true Paſtors of true viſible Churches that wee deny: &amp; that you shal never be able to prove: but if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch preaching by ſuch preachers the L. work with the people, ſo as that they gladly receave the word, repent, &amp; beleeve, &amp; deſire to walk in the truth, &amp; therevppon do pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe to the L. &amp; each to other to walk in his wayes, this promiſe maketh them a true Church: &amp; then if they choſe among them men able to lead &amp; ſeed them, &amp; appoint ſuch men to ſuch office, the men ſo choſen &amp; apointed are the true Paſtors which the Scripture deſcribeth: but what is all this to your aſſemblies &amp; Miniſters? who as yet have not caſt of the yoke of Antichriſtian bondage, whoſe communion &amp; miniſtery is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, but remayneth firme, the ſame in nature (though much bettered in degre) with the Romane aſſemblies Eccleſiaſtical: &amp; whereas you in this particular object to vs, that two or three of vs Seperated from you, &amp; gathered together into the new Teſtament of Chriſt, aſſume powre to make Miniſters, a practiſe (as you ſay) farre from plaine evidence of Scripture, or any practiſe of the Church theſe thouſand yeeres: I answer it is no mater for the practiſe of the Church theſe thouſand yeeres, for Gregory the great Bb. of Rome who lived a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeeres ſince, hoyſed vp Antichriſt into the higheſt exaltation againſt God &amp; his Chriſt in a manner: &amp; his Succeſſors eſpecially Boniface &amp; ſome other have maintayned &amp; enlarged that Antichriſtian Kingdom even to our dayes: &amp; yet the miſtery

               <p>The next point to be handled is your ſeaventh in nomber, viz.</p>
               <p>That a miniſter may be made without Elders (ordinarily I meane) for extraordinary courſes are not now to be vſed for ought I ſee: this point you blame as error: Let vs ſee whether it be error or not.</p>
               <p>I hold that a miniſter may be made without Elders: more plainly I ſay that when the Church wanteth Elders, the Church hath powre to Elect, approve &amp; ordeyne her owne Elders, alſo: to elect, approve, &amp; ordeine her owne Deacons both men &amp; woemen: For if you remember what was before ſpoken to your fifth poſition, viz: that the church hath the powre of Chr in it ſelf, viz: that it hath Chr. the covenant, &amp; al the promiſes given to it being yet but few in nomber, &amp; that the Church hath theſe things in true title &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as her owne freehold then you shal ſee what wil follow hervppon: namely that the Church hath powre to receave in members &amp; caſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out members, to receave in her Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers &amp; to diſchardg the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of office, the church hath powre to the preaching of the word to the adminiſtring of the ſeales of the covenant, to binding &amp; loſing, which workes she cannot do herſelf being many, therfor she appointeth fit perſons therto, viz: ſuch officers as Chriſt hath given to his Church, which are the Elders, ſtil notwithſtanding reſerving her powre to herſelf when occaſion shalbe offered: theſe things are ſufficiently proved already in answer to your fifth imputation: but you have ſome thing perhaps to ſay for ordination; that the Church hath not powre of it: then belike al the promiſes are not gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven to the Church, for if ordination be not given to the Church, then the miniſtery is not given to the Church, for it ſeemeth you make ordination a great part of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but know for your learning that ordination doth give nothing at al to the Miniſter: For election is the ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e eſſence &amp; forme of the miniſter: for in election powre to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is given to the officer elect: For when the Church choſeth the miniſter, doth not the Church in effect ſay: we give the A. b, powre to adminiſter the word, ſeales of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3153:65"/>covenant, &amp; cenſures in the behalf of the whole Church? &amp; the miniſter Elect doth then actually poſſeſſe &amp; aſſume that powre delegated vnto him by the Church: ſo when the Church choſeth her Deacons doth she not in effect ſpeake thus: we give you, c.d.e.f. powre to collect, &amp; diſtribute the Churches Treaſury, &amp; to miniſter for the body &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers of the Church in other general ſervices, helpful to the body &amp; outward part: this is evident enough if you wil not be blind wilfully: For as in matter of mariage, this is the very forme of mariage: I take the formy wife, &amp; I take the for my husband: So in the matter of office this is the very forme therof: we take the for our Paſtor: I take you for my flock: &amp; ſo forth of the reſt: now ordination is nothing but the publishing of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers election with prayer made for him &amp; admonition given to him to be faithful: The Church doth the former which is al in all even the very forme, the latter is but the leſſer &amp; an accident without which the officer may be a true officer: declare the contrarie to this if you can if not yeeld to the truth.</p>
               <p>Ob. But you wil ſay the word mentioneth an Eldership which muſt ordeine, &amp; Paul commandeth Titus to ordeyne Elders, Tit. 1.5. 1. Tim. 4.14.</p>
               <p>Ans. 1. The place of Timothie compared with 2. Timoth, 1.6. yeeldeth this ſence, that Timothie by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he exerciſe of prophecy wherein he was trayned, &amp; by the impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtles handes whereby the extraordinary gifts of tongs &amp; prophecy were then vſually conferred, had an excellent grace (ſo the word is in the originall) conferred vppon him.</p>
               <p>But let it be granted that Timothie had a miniſterie conferred vnto him, ſurely it muſt needes be the office of an Evangeliſt, &amp; what is that to an ordinary Elders office: Paull only &amp; the Apoſtles could create Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>Further let it be yeelded you that Timothie was made a Bishop of Epheſus by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership of Epheſus, the Eldership in that action did nothing but that which the Church appointed them to, &amp; for the effecting wherof they had powre &amp; authority from the Church who is the Fountaine of al the powre that any officer hath.</p>
               <p>Ans. 2. To the place of Titus I thus answer, that Titus ther is not commaunded to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne miniſters, but to conſtitute Elders: For the word is not to ordeyne, or to lay on hands, but to conſtitute: if you vnderſtand the Greek tongue you wil acknowledg that I ſay to be true: now to conſtitute an Elder ſignifieth Election, approbation, &amp; ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not ordination only as the objection importeth: but you know, or els you are a ſworne ſlave to the Prelates, that the Church hath powre to Elect &amp; approve her Elders: yet Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus is heer commaunded to doe it: whence wee muſt needes conclude that Titus only should teach &amp; direct the Churches in conſtituting of her Elders according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique inſtitution: which what it was Titus being an Evangeliſt &amp; wel acquainted with the Apoſtles courſe, could wel tel: &amp; this muſt needes be the ſence of this place, except you have any thing to ſay againſt it, which we pray you let vs heer if ther be any thing: you ſeeme in this point to diſtingnish the calling of Elders; as if ther were two manners or formes of calling Elders ordinary &amp; extraordinary: I know no ſuch thing, &amp; therfore I leave that till I ſee it expounded.</p>

                     <p>The Minor only is doubtful which may thus be confirmed, Gal. 3.14-16. wher the Apoſtle ſaith plainly that the promiſes were made to Abraham &amp; his ſeed, viz: to the Faithful, vs. 16. that the bleſſing of Abraham came vppon the beleeving gentils: vs. 14. &amp; that theſe promiſes &amp; bleſſing is the covenant or new Teſtament, vs. 15. wherevppon it followeth that ſeing the Faithful have the bleſſing, the promiſes, the new Teſtament, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>for they have the powre of enjoying the miniſtery: For the miniſtery is one part or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the new Teſtament.</p>

               <p> This point you ſay is alſo erroneous: let vs conſider of it I pray you ſeriouſly: I would know into what Faith they are baptized if not into the Faith of the church of England, they are members of the Church of England, &amp; they profeſſe the Faith of the Church of England, are they not then baptized into that Faith of the Church wherof they ſtand as members, &amp; of which Faith they make profeſſion? are they baptized into one Faith, and do they profeſſe another Faith? or do you think that the Faith of Chriſt &amp; the Faith of the Church of Engeland are not one? me thinkes Mr. Bern. you lay a fowle imputation vppon your Church: in holding that the Faith of the Church of England is not the faith of Chriſt, &amp; that baptiſme is not adminiſtred into the Faith of the Church of England reſpectively, but into the faith of Chriſt ſimply. I dare ſay your Lords the Prelates wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you litle thank for this geare: but let vs conſider of your Faiths: The Prelates &amp; Church of England have one Faith wherto they Subſcribe: The Puritanes &amp; their Faction have an other Faith, for they wil not Subſcribe to the Prelates Faith: Chriſt &amp; wee of the Seperation have a third Faith, for we wil Subſcribe neither to the Bbs.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3153:67"/>of the Sep.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n. whoſe whole book in the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of it was directed againſt this lettre of myne as may evidently be perceaved as in the whole tenor of it, ſo eſpecially in theſe two particulars againſt which he excepteth in this Section.</p>
                  <p>Now for the firſt let vs conſider the intendment of the baptizer: How the Miniſters of the Church of England intend their baptiſme: How the law of the Land intendeth bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: how the Service-book intendeth &amp; directeth baptiſme: how the parents Suſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Suretyes do demaund baptiſme &amp; conſent to baptiſme adminiſtred: &amp; vppon the conceaving of theſe particulars the baptiſme muſt be cenſured: now if al theſe intend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely that Faith which is by law eſtablished in the Land, &amp; that the partie is baptized into that Faith which they intend, it wil follow neceſſarily that baptiſme is adminiſtred not ſimply &amp; indefinitely into the Faith of Chriſt, but particularly &amp; definitely into that Faith which the Bbs. &amp; the Church of England do teach &amp; profeſſe: For which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration an argument may be framed thus.</p>
                  <p>Into that faith are the members of the Church of England baptized, which the Law eſtablisheth: which the Prelates &amp; Miniſters teach: which the Church of England profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: which the miniſter baptiſing intendeth: &amp; wherto the parents, witneſſes or Suſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors conſent: &amp; which the Service-book expreſly mentioneth.</p>
                  <p>But the law doth not eſtablish: the Prelates &amp; miniſters do not teach: the Church of England doth not profeſſe: the baptizer doth not intend: the parents &amp; Suſceptors doe not conſent to: &amp; the Servicebook doth not mention the Faith of Chriſt ſimply, but the Faith of Bbs. or Church of England.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, The members of the Church of England are not baptized into the Faith of Chriſt ſimply, but into the Fayth of the Bbs. or Church of England, which is the falſe Fayth of the baptizer, of the Suertyes or parents, and ſo the Faith of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond point let vs conſider the faith &amp; repentance of the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, I meane of the faith that is viſibly profeſſed &amp; expreſſed in the fruites of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them &amp; therby we shal know the tree.</p>
                  <p>The faith of that Church is not a true faith which teach &amp; profeſſe a falſe mediator: &amp; the repentance of that Church is not a true repentance, which practiſe according to that falſe doctryne.</p>
                  <p>But the aſſemblies Eccleſiaſtical of England with the teachers &amp; profeſſors of them, teach and profeſſe a falſe Mediator: For they teach that Chriſt is a Mediator of all that falſe Church, Miniſtery, VVorship and Government, eſtablished in the Land: Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and making interceſſion for them in the dayly practiſe al thoſe abhominations: Ruling and Governing them by all the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy, and by the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3153:68"/>courts &amp; canons Eccleſiaſtical, which are the inventions of the man of ſinne: Teaching &amp; Propheſying vnto them by thoſe Antichriſtian, Prelates, Preiſts, &amp; Deacons, which raigne in the Land: &amp; ſo practiſing according to this falſe Faith practiſe a falſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, the Faith of the Church of England, of the teachers &amp; profeſſors therof, &amp; the repentance of them is not true, but falſe.</p>
                  <p>But it wilbe objected againſt both theſe aſſertions that although one thing be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in baptiſme, yet the Lord may admit of &amp; accept another &amp; though they profeſſe &amp; preach falſely, yet the Lord he can &amp; doth no doubt work mervaylouſly beſides al that we can think or ſpeak: Truth I yeeld it moſt willingly: &amp; bleſſed be the Lord for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite &amp; vnſpeakeable mercy therein: but we diſpute not what God can do of his powre or wil, do of his mercy, things vnknowne vnto vs: but we ſpeake of things revealed and manifeſted vnto vs, according whervnto we muſt walk &amp; judg of matters according to that which we ſee: according as the word judgeth: according as the Church &amp; members of the Church of England teach, profeſſe, &amp; practiſe viſibly, which is ſeen &amp; diſcerned of vs, we are to paſſe our cenſure: but we judg no man before the tyme: we doe not clyme vp into Gods judgment ſeate: our Faith is viſible: our repentance is viſible: our charity viſible: our Spirit viſible: our baptiſme viſible: our preaching viſible: our covenant viſible, our Church viſible: our judgment viſible: things that are revealed aperteyne to vs &amp; our Children, that ſay we is falſe in the aſſemblies Eccleſiaſtical: Secreat things aperteyne to the Lord: theſe we leave to the Lord, we medle not with them: this I deſire may once for al be remembred &amp; pondered, &amp; ſo I end this matter.</p>

Theſ. 2.4, wher it is ſaid that Antichriſt ſitteth in the Temple of God, is falſely by you conceaved &amp; interpreted, for it doth not import that (as you would have it), Antichriſts Church, &amp; the true Church of Chriſt are one &amp; the ſame, &amp; that the ſame company of men can be, and are, both the true viſible Church of Chriſt, &amp; at that ſame tyme the Church of Antichriſt: this is impoſſible: for the true Church is not the falſe Church. But this is the meaning, viz: either that Antichriſt shal ſitt in the conſciences of men which is properly the Temple of God: Or that Antichriſt shall ariſe vp out of that company of men which once were the Temple of God, as Rome was: or that the Church being true in the conſtitution, Antichriſt shal foyſt into it by litle and litle his falſe miniſtery, VVorship, and Government, as experience teacheth he hath done: For a true Church may have Antichriſtian ordinances retayned &amp; raiſed vp in it: this being the true meaning of the Apoſtle, how can you hence conclude ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the true Church tooke poſſeſſion of the Temples, which the falſe Church of Antichriſt built? Seing the true Church is not the falſe Church, &amp; ſeing that the temples were built in the palpable darknes of groſſe popery, ſome of them perhaps dedicated to heathen Idols, ſome of them to Antichriſtian Idols, as ther Hee, &amp; shee Saints; al of them to Devils. For if Ieroboams Preiſts were appointed for Devils, 2. Chron. 11.15. &amp; if the Antichriſtian preiſts are the Spirit of Devils, Revel. 16.14. &amp; the worship of Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the worship of Devils, Revel. 9.20. &amp; the Antichriſtian Churches the habitation of Devils, Revel. 18.2. then the Temples are dedicated to Devils: not that they intended ſo to dedicate them. but for that they are ſo indeed the Lord accounting that to be done to the Devil, which is not done to him as he hath commaunded: &amp; the Devill ſubſtituting himſelf in Gods place, when men go a whoring after ther owne inventions: Therefor the Apoſtle ſaith plainly that the Gentils Sacrifice to Devils, 1.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3153:78"/>whither wee would that the word should be vtterly extingnished, or preached by your falſe miniſtery, I make answer: wee would neither of them: but wee deſire both that your falſe miniſtery were diſſolved, &amp; that the word might by the Kings commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or allowance, or permiſſion bee preached throughout his dominions by men fitted therto: wherefore in this point I challendg you for an vncharitable ſlaunderer of vs: and heer you digreſſe to prove that the word may bee preached without a true conſtitution of a Church: &amp; that preaching is more neceſſary then a true conſtitution: I confeſſe it vnfeynedly &amp; moſt hartily: neither came the contrary into the thoughts of the brethren of the Seperation I ſuppoſe: For certainly the true conſtitution muſt bee taught, &amp; men muſt bee brought to the faith, before the Church can bee conſtituted: &amp; this is it which wee muſt labor for, that firſt the word be preached by men of able gifts, &amp; that men bee taught &amp; converted to the Faith, &amp; then they bee eſtabliſhed into the new Teſtament of Chriſt but you have done &amp; doe practiſe the contrary: Firſt, you have eſtabliſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into an Antichriſtian communion &amp; conſtitution jumbling together al the people of the Land, of what Religion or condition ſoever, &amp; then you ſet over them a falſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, &amp; then teach them ſtil to hold &amp; retayne that Antichriſtian conſtitution, miniſtery worship, &amp; government, placed over them: &amp; wholy to reject any reformation offered: &amp; in this your diſgreſſion you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>unne out into another calumny, viz: that ſome of vs are ſo in diſlike with your Church, as that wee would rather intertayne popery, then returne to you againe: For my ſelf I confeſſe my thoughts &amp; ſpeeches have been &amp; are to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that whenſoever I returne to keep communion with the English aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them true Churches, &amp; their Miniſtery true, then muſt I alſo of neceſſity acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledg Rome to be a true conſtituted Church, &amp; their miniſtery true: For your Church &amp; miniſtery are of the ſame nature &amp; kind, though of divers degrees of corruption, yours being much refined from infinite droſſe which is ſtil remayning with them. Now if I should returne to ſucceſſion, &amp; ſo acknowledg, the Eaſt churches of the Grecians, and the VVeſt Churches of Rome, &amp; her Daughters wherof England is one (for Rome is the Mother-Church.) to be true Churches, yet I would make my choiſe ther to joyne wher are feweſt corruptions: &amp; ſo rather returne to you then to Rome: &amp; therefore herein I ſuppoſe alſo you are but a ſlaunderer, in advancing a falſe report, Pſalm. 15.3. wherefore brefly I ſay, to deſire your reformation, &amp; the truth to be practiſed among you, is neither hatred of you (as you ſtrongly plead) nor any vncharitable deſire to have the truth extinguished, and popery intertayned, as you moſt vncharitably ſuggeſt vnto your Reader.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our vncharitablenes appeareth (you ſay) in this that we envy that good things proſper with you: wretched man that you are thus to ſlaunder &amp; calumniate vs falſely: I profeſſe that I wish from my Soule, that every Formaliſt in the Land were a Reformiſt, &amp; that every Reformiſt were of the Seperation, &amp; this is al the hurt that wee wish vnto you: whereas you object that the Seperation, &amp; this is al the hurt that wee wish vnto you: whereas you object that the Seperation ſcoffe at your Religious exerciſes and your converſion: I doe deteſt ſcoffing, &amp; if I my ſelf have at any tyme ſcoffed I doe proclayme my repentance for it vnto you &amp; the whole Land: yet know that ſcoffing at Baals preiſts was lawfull in Elias, if you cal ſcoffing an Eironie: neither doe we ſcoffe at any thing that is good, but at your irrecoverable ſtifnes in your corrupted courſes: neither is this ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>onie uſed as a mock to diſgrace you, but as a meanes to reforme you as Elias his eironie was:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3153:78"/>againe you ſay wee pray not for your Miniſters, but wish diſcontentment, that men may thereby come to the Seperation: I answer wee pray for the Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they may repent and yeeld to the truth: and wee wish that men may bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with their corrupt and evil wayes, which is the high way to repentance: but wee wish no man through diſcontentment of poverty, or reproach, or diſgrace to fall from any truth, as it ſeemeth you have done from Puritaniſme to the Prelates faction &amp; conformity: Further you vrge vncharitablenes in haſty excommunications for ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters: I answer, (not for others) but for our particular Church of the Seperation, that wee doe not vſe excommunication as a matter of hatred, but of love, neyther doe wee excommunicate any man but for finne convinced, and that after once and twiſe admonition, and that is not haſtily: and whereas you teach vs not to excommunicate for every ſinne wee doe practiſe your advertiſement: but if you wil have vs retaine in our communion any ſinner willfully impenitent and peevishly obſtinate ſinne, wee answer, that wee abhorre your counſel, and wee think ſuch perſons fitter for your Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Synagogues, then for the true Church of Chriſt, which is a communion of Saints only.</p>
                  <p>Againe, you cenſure the Seperation of vncharitablenes for excommunicating them that heer the word of your Miniſters: I deny it except they continue impenitent in that ſinne: and then indeed wee doe: and the reaſon is, bicauſe wee hold according to the truth, that you are falſe Churches, and falſe Miniſters, and that wee ought not to have any Spirituall communion with Idols: and doe you think that impenitency in Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not worthy excommunication? and doe you think that impenitency in Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not worthy excommunication? and for that you ſay it is no ſinne to heare the true word of any man: I ask whither you think it lawfull to heare the Popish preiſts preach, &amp; to pray with them: if it bee vnlawful then you are answered: and the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth to heare falſe Prophets. Deut. 13.3. &amp; the Apoſtle willeth to Seperate from ſuch as teach falſe Doctryne, 1. Timoth. 6.3-5. to reject an Heretique after once and twiſe admonition: Tit. 3.10. and not to give entertayment to the falſe teachers. 2. Iohn. 10.</p>
                  <p>Heer I omit your gibe of the annoyning which is the Holy Ghoſt, that the Apoſtle ſaith the Faithful have to teach them all truth, whereby the brethren of the Seperation preſume (as you ſay) to teach wanting gifts: &amp; referre you to the Apoſtles ſpeech. 1. Cor. 14. wher he willeth al the brethren to endevor to prophecy: &amp; teacheth them that they may prophecy one by one: &amp; wil you to remember that this gibe of yours falleth vppon Paul, the Holy Scriptures, the Spirit of God, &amp; Chriſt Ieſus the mediator or of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament which hath eſtablished the exerciſe of Prophecy in the Church for all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that have gifts: &amp; ther is no man that doth beleeve but he can ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Finally, this want of love which you impute to vs, I wonder how it is bettered amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you who perſecute one another ſo hatefully as you do: as the Prelates &amp; their factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do devoure the reformiſts &amp; ther faction: So as it ſeemeth you are blind at home, though you can ſee ſo dragon-like abroad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Synne you impute to vs is miſaledging, &amp; wreſting the Scriptures: inſtances you give none, onely you ſay that ſome have accuſed ſome of the principals of vs: but doth it follow therefore that the accuſation is true? Chriſt was accuſed for blaſphemy: was hee therefore a blaſphemer? But if you meane that the Miniſters in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3153:79"/>the conference of Coventre with my ſelf have accuſed mee thereof: I answer it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I knew the Seperation, as you &amp; they can tel: &amp; what is this to the Seperation: but for their chardging me with wreſting the Scriptures I answer that wherein I have wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Scripture it is of ignorance, &amp; I doe not preſently remember the particulars: Let them bee produced to the world, I deſire no ſavor, if it bee my ſinne I will confeſſe it, but neither doe I know it, neither do you prove it, only you ſay it, &amp; whither you muſt be beleeved on your bare word that are ſo common a ſlaunderer in this your book I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre mee to the Cenſure of every man that is not partiall, and doteth not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Synne you chardg vs with is wilful perſiſting in Schiſme joyned with contempt &amp; ſcorne of others: I answer: doe not you wilfully perſiſt in your Schiſme from Rome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning &amp; ſcorning of them? you will ſay, they are in error: &amp; wee ſay you are in error, &amp; that the difference betwixt you &amp; vs is more, then betwixt you &amp; them: For your conſtitution, miniſtery, &amp; Government is one with theirs: but wee are oppoſite vnto you in all theſe. If it be no finne in you thus to deale with Rome: it is no ſinne in vs thus to deale with you: but I deny vtterly that wee Schiſme from you: For ther can bee no Schiſme from a falſe Church, miniſtery, worship, &amp; Government, except it be Schiſme to depart out of Babylon.</p>
                  <p>Againe we do neither contemne nor ſcorne any man, only we ſingle the truth, &amp; leave their corruptions &amp; errors, &amp; refuſe to build our Faith vppon men, or Churches, or falſe expoſitions of Scriptures: &amp; we deſire no man to come to vs further then wee have the truth, which whither we have or not, I referre it &amp; muſt doe to the conſcience of every one that loveth the truth, who shal live by his owne Fayth, and dye for his owne ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Synne you caſt vppon vs is Rayling, Scoffing, and blaſpheming, this you exemplify in two particulars, 1. Mr. Barrowes sharp ſpeeches in the diſcovery, 2. our approbation of it in him.</p>
                  <p>I answer: Firſt: that Mr. Barrowes Scripture phraſes whatſoever I doe approve, &amp; juſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fy them fitly to be applyed to your falſe Church, Miniſtery, worship, &amp; Government: &amp; til you have forſaken al that falſehood they doe deſervedly lye vppon you: Secondly, The phraſes which Mr. Barrow alledgeth &amp; borroweth els where, I dare not either alow them or reprove them, bicauſe I know not what particular motion of the Spirit guided him ſo to write: but the things ſignified by thoſe phraſes declaring the Idolatry of your Church, Miniſtery, VVorship, and Government, I approve. Thirdly, that Mr. Barrow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronically vpbraydeth the preaching and VVorship of the aſſemblies, following therein Elias his example, I dare not cenſure that as an vngodly act of his though I doubt not but you doe performe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe Religious exerciſes in the honeſty of your ignorance, as I my ſelf ſomtyme did. Fourthly, that he ſpecially inveigheth againſt the Reformiſts he doth it not for that they are the worſt men, but for that by their doings the Lords truth is moſt hindered, they being like the Phariſees apteſt to deceave. Finally, I wil not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the defence of Mr. Barrowes tartnes, neither dare I abſolutely condemne it, ſeing the Prophet Eſay is as sharpe againſt the true Church as ever was Mr. Barrow againſt your falſe Church: &amp; whereas you alledg my writing vppon the Lords prayer before I ſaw the Seperation, as a confutation or contradiction to Mr. Barrow, I ſay you may aswel

Theſe faithfull people wherſoever they ariſe in the VVorld, muſt be Seperated from the VVorld, and from all vncleanenes whatſoever: For the faithfull muſt not draw the yoake with vnbeleevers, righteouſnes can have no fellowship with vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, light can have no communion with darknes, Chriſt can have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with Behall, that is, with a Societie that is without his yoke, the beleever can have no part with the vnbeleever, and the Temple of God can have no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Idols. 2. Corinth. 6.16.18. Apoc. 14.9-11. Deut. 22.10. &amp; 7.2.3.6. Act. 19.9. Ephe. 5.7.11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A few faithfull people ſtanding in confuſion with vnbeleevers, vnſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them, being one bodie with them, in that eſtateſtanding are not a true church of Chriſt, which I prove by divers reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The faithful have the Spirit of Chriſt, the vnbeleevers have the Spirit of ſatan, how can theſe two contrarie Spirits, theſe two contrarie ſorts of perſons combyne together, 2. Cor. 6.14.15.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ther is enimity put betwixt theſe two ſortes of perſons, ergo: they cannot combine together, ſee Gen. 3.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The covenant, promiſes, Chriſt, is the faithfuls only: how can vnbeleevers have any part in them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Seing the faithfull being but few, have the covenant, promiſes, Chriſt, therefore they have powre to all the meanes whereby they shall enjoy Chriſt as the word, ſeales of the covenant, the miniſterie, the powre of binding and loſing, for all theſe are parts of the covenant, they are the promiſes, they are the meanes of pertaking Chriſt. Roman. 3.2. and 4.11. Act. 6.5. and 14.23. Math. 18.18.20. 1. Cor. 3.21.22. 2. Pet. 1.3.4. 1. Tim. 4.8.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As they have the powre of all theſe things, ſo they are commaunded to vſe al theſe helpes, and are bound to obey the Lord in uſing all theſe meanes for enjoying Chriſt, therefore they are bound to vſe the word, the ſeales of the covenant, the miniſterie, the cenſures for their owne mutuall good. Deuter. 5.31.32.33. and 6.17. and 12.32. 1. Corint. 14.37. 1. Tim. 5.21. &amp; 6.13.14. Gal. 3.15. Iam. 1.19-22.1. Cor. 11.24. 25. Act. 6.3. Heb. 13.17. Mat. 18.15.17.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The faithfull muſt be Seperated from the wicked and vnbeleevers, 2. Corinth. 6.17. They muſt Seperate wicked men from among them by the cenſures, 1. Corinth. 5.13. Math. 18.15.17. 2. Theſſa 3.6.14. They muſt choſe, aprove &amp; ordeine their owne Elders &amp; Deacons, Act. 6.3. &amp; 14.23. 1. Tim, 3.10 &amp; 6.13.14. As wel as vſe the word and ſeales of the covenant.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If the faithfull either doe not Seperate themſelves from the wicked, or not Seperate the vnbeleevers from them: if they ſtill mingle with them they forfeite the covenant, they conſent to all the ſinne of the vnbeleevers, to all their prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy things: ſeing God hath given them power to reforme themſelves, and to keepe all wicked perſons from among their communion by the cenſures of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and excommunication, Apoc. 18. 4 Eph. 5.7.11, 1. Cor. 5.6. Mat. 13.33. 1. Cor. 12.17.22. Levit. 17.19. Mat. 22.39. Mat. 18.15.17.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb facs="tcp:3153:82"/> 10. If Kings and States forbid the faithfull to vſe any of theſe helps and meanes which God hath given and commaunded them to vſe, they are to loſe their lives rather then to forbeare, bicauſe they are bound to obey God rather then men, Act. 4.19. Deut. 12.32.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If Princes and States commaund the Church and faithfull to entertaine any other ordinances, then theſe before rehearſed, they are not to obey, but rather to leeſe their lives, 1. Tim. 6.13.14. Mat. 16.24.25. Apoc. 22.18.19.</p>
            <p>Mr. S. theſe are the very grounds and principles of our cauſe, which is the Lords truth, there are divers other particulars which I thincke not fitt to relate vnto you: They may be after diſcovered vnto you vppon occaſion: Now I come to anſwere your reaſons for your Church and miniſterie: Firſt, you ſay you have a true church your reaſon is, for that you have the word truly preached, and the Sacraments duely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe that whereſoever theſe thinges are found there is a true Church, but I denie the word to bee truly Preached, and the Sacraments duely adminiſtred in any parish Church of England, which I maniteſt vnto you after this manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, the people pertakinge in the ſeales of the covenante in prayer, and in the communion of Holy thinges: are not a people Seperated from all the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, open ſinners of the Land, but ſtand ſtill in conluſion with them, ſubmittinge to all the falſe Government of the Prelates, &amp;c. Such a people ſo ſtandinge have no title to the covenant, to Chriſt, to the promiſes, ſee the firſt ground: ſupra.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, this people ſo mingled with the wicked of the Land, cannot be a true Church, ſeinge it is impoſſible for them to be conjoyned &amp; combyned together into one bodie, as the true Church is. For as two diſparate ſeeds, viz: of an horſe and an aſſe, doe not produce either an Horſe or an Aſſe, but a mule. Geneſ. 36.24. So of the two contrarie ſeeds of the VVoman and of the Serpent, Geneſ. 3.15. can not proceede a true Church, but ſome thing of another nature, viz: a falſe Church: VVherefore in the falſe Church cannot the word be truly preached, &amp; the Sacraments duely adminiſtred.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, there is one only true forme of a viſible Church. Epheſ. 4.4. One bodie, which bodie is called Chriſt, 1. Corinth. 12.12. Galat. 3.16. This one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath one Spirit, Epheſ. 4.4. This one body guided by this one Spirit, hath one Lord. Epheſ. 4.5. VVhich Lord is Chriſt the onely Lawgiver: It hath alſo one faith, which is the faith expreſſed in the writings of the Apoſtles. it hath alſo one Baptiſme whereby men are admitted into this faith, ſubmitted vnto this Lord, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into this Spirit, incorporated into this bodie: and ſo have one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: one hope of life everlaſtinge, to whome the promiſes and covenant is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Now in the aſſemblies of England there are divers Faythes, one off the Puritanes ſo miſcalled, another of the Prelates, a third of the Papiſtes that
<pb facs="tcp:3153:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>come to Churche, a fourth of the ignorant perſons. go, they cannot be one, &amp; they denye themſelves to be of the ſame body with Papiſts, Atheiſts, Prelates, witches conjurers, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, murtherers, blaſphemers, drunckerds, vſurers, &amp;c. Therfor they are not the true body of Chriſt, the true Church of God, therfore all the holy things are profaned, when they are ther adminiſtred, how then can they be ſaid, as you plead to be truly adminiſtred in the aſſemblies of England.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Add herevnto that the moſt forward Preachers &amp; Profeſſors of the Land do not practize according to that which they know the Lord requireth to be practiſed, viz: in admitting of al to the Holy things good &amp; bad, in neglecting the cenſures vtterly: in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Miniſters calling from the prelates whome they hold Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in ſubmitting to their Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction which is vnlawful therby yealding their conſciences to other Lawgivers then Chriſt: For their canno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Chriſts lawes are contrary: how can we ſay that they that thus doe, ſinning againſt their conſciences, in this manner, are Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from al ſinne, touch no vncleane thing, &amp; ſo how can they be ſaid in that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution the true Church, &amp; ſo how can the word be ſaid truly preached &amp; the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments duely adminiſtred in that eſtate?</p>
            <p>Thus Mr. S. you ſee your Church is proved not to be true, &amp; your ſignes of a true church therfore not to be found in your aſſemblies. Your ſecond point foloweth, viz: that your miniſterie is a true miniſterie: I pray you how can ther be a true miuiſterie, where is a falſe Church: doth not the true miniſterie ariſe out of the true Church? can there be a true miniſterie &amp; a falſe Church? I know not how theſe things can ſtand together.</p>
            <p>But let vs heare your arguments, to prove your true miniſterie.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you ſay ther is a true miniſterie bicauſe men are converted thereby: I anſwere converſion is no ſigne of a true miniſterie: For Prophets, Preiſts, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prophets, Paſtors, private men, private women have converted, Iohn. 4.39. Phillip. 1.14.15. 1. Cor. 14.24.31. Act. 9.1. &amp; 11.19.21. Ergo: converſion apertaineth not only to miniſters nither is it a proper effect or adjunct of a true miniſterie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let your argument be framed after a true forme: it wilbe this: whoſoever converteth ſoules is a true Paſtor: The miniſters of the church of England convert ſoules go, they are true Paſtors.</p>
            <p>I make another argument: whoſoever converteth ſoules is an Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 9.2. The miniſters of England convert ſoules, go: they are Apoſtles: The like arguments may be made to prove the miniſters of England, Prieſts, extraordinary Prophets, evangeliſtes, yea Chriſt himſelfe, Mat. 11.5. Ierm. 23.22. Malach. 4.6. Act. 8.12. Now Mr. S. judge whither your Argument be good, to prove a true miniſterie, yea or nay.</p>
            <p>Thirdly I would know whither you thinke that the Miniſters of the Romish Church are true Miniſters, yea or nay: but it is manifeſt, Apoc. 18, 4. that Gods people are in Rome how came they thyther? ther they are converted: how was Luther, Huſſe, Ierom of Prage the waldenſes converted? how were they converted in King Henrie the 8. tyme? anſwere this if you can I pray you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is not the worke of the Officers of the Church to convert ſoules, but to ſede &amp; edifie them being convertedia Paſtor doth not make shepe, but fedeth, guideth, &amp; tendeth his shepe: the members of the true Church are al Saints, now Saints are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted already: and the Officers of the Church are converſant about the Saints conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:3153:83"/>not about the profane vnconverted, you know a shepherd &amp; a flock are convertible: therfore the place Ephe. 4.12, doth not ſignifie as it is tranſtated gathering or converting the Saints. But it ſignifieth the joyning of them as you may ſee, Gal. 6.1. &amp; the mending of any thinge, Mat. 4.21.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, how can you or any man prove to me out of the word that you convert ſoules by your miniſterie? men that are converted, are converted to the true faith, which is one, which true faith is only in the true Church, which is the body Chriſt, which is but one, Eph. 4.4.5.6. But your Church is not true, therfor your faith is not true, therfor you convert none to the true faith which Gods word doth declare vnto vs: I confeſſe that ther are thouſands which I am perſwaded aperteyne to the Lords election, but which they be in particular I certainly know not: I hope wel of you &amp; manie more that I know.</p>
            <p>Now that your faith is not true I prove thus: They which beleve not Chriſt to be their King, or if they know him to be ther King, do not ſubmit to his Kingdom have not the true ſaith, Luk. 19.27. But none of you in your aſſemblies beleeve Chriſt to be your King, or if ye do yeeld not to his Kingdome, which is his viſible Church, &amp; the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therof, ſeing you mingle with al the profane in the Land, reject his Officers, ſubmit to the Prelates vnlawful authoritie Eccleſiaſtical, neglect his lawes, ſtatutes &amp; Iudgements, viz: the cenſures of admonition &amp; excommunication.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you ſay you have a true miniſteri, 1. bicauſe God hath ſent you, bicauſe he hath given you giftes, 2. you are allowed to exerciſe your gifts by ſome approved there vnto, &amp; 3. your gifts are approved by your people among whom you adminiſter, this is the ſome of your reaſon, where vnto I anſwere many thinges, firſt to your firſt point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God ſendeth none ordinarily, but thoſe whome the true Church ſendeth, but your is not the true Church as is proved: therfor God ſendeth you not, ſeing you are not ſent by the true Church, which you have not: againe it doth not follow that bicauſe you have giftes, that therfor you are ſent, for ther be among the Popish Preiſts men that have excellent gifts, &amp; yet you wil not ſay they are ſent: ſo among the common &amp; civill lawyers, ther are men that have giftes, yet you cannot ſay, they are ſent: Laſtly, if you be ſent of God, how is it that contrarie to the L. commaundement you keepe ſilence when the Prelates ſilence you? For if God hath ſent you, who can forbid you?</p>
            <p n="2">2. To your ſecond point I anſwere thus: viz: 1. that the allowance you have, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the true Church muſt &amp; doth &amp; can only give ſufficient allowance or powre to her Officers, which you have not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Prelates which are in vnlawful Eccleſiaſtical authoritie, can give no ſufficient authoritie or allowance to true Miniſters, for can good come from evill? 3. if you ſay you have your authoritie from the civil State, I anſwere, the civil State can not give Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical authoritie, 4. if you chalenge your powre from ſome Presbyterie of Miniſters: I anſwer they muſt shew that they have powre to give you authoritie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſay as before, that every particular viſible Church, which is a communion of Saints and faithful people, hath al powre Eccleſiaſtical with in it ſelfe, which your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes can not have, bicauſe they are confuſed rowtes, mingle mangles of al ſortes, cages to hold every vncleane and hateful bird, Apoc. 18.2. contrarie to Deut. 14.2.3.11.12. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
<pb facs="tcp:3153:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>equally yoaked contrarie to the Type. Deuter. 22. to. And contrarie to the truth, 2. Corinth 6.14. and therefore it is impoſſible that you should have a true callinge, from them who have no powre of Chriſt given them to enjoy the covenant, promiſes, Chriſt, or any meanes to partake Chriſt: as is already proved vnto you, &amp; ſo your third point all ſo falleth to the ground.</p>
            <p>Breefly therefore to diſcover vnto you the true callinge which is onely one, for there is onely one true way for Officers to enter into Office, viz: that way which is taught by Chriſt, for he is the dore into the Shepefold, and whoſoever climeth vp any other way (Chriſt ſaith) is a theſe and a robber, Iohn. 10.1.7.9, the true calling is this. 1. A company of faithful people, 2. muſt be Seperate from all wicked men, 3. joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together into covenant to enjoy all Gods ordinances. 4. aſſembled with faſting, and prayer, 5. muſt choſe out from among themſelves, one or more able perſons, 6. muſt be approved according to the rules: mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1. Timoth. 3. and afterward, 7. charged &amp; commaunded to adminiſter faith fully that this is ſo, theſe places witnes, Roman. 1.7. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Corinth. 1.2. Epheſ. 1.4. Apocal. 17.14. and 15.3. Apocal. 18.4. 2. Corinth. 6.17. Epheſ. 5.7. Deuter, 29.9.13. Ioſua. 24.25. Act. 3.25. Heb. 8.10. Act. 13.2.3. and 14.23. &amp; 6.5.1. Tim. 3.10. Tit. 1.6.9.1. Tim. 6.3.14. Act. 20.28. 1. Pet, 5.1.3.4.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. S. shew mee ſuch a Church, and ſuch a Miniſterie, in any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Church in England, and I will acknowledg it a true Church, and that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, a true miniſterie: but if you cannot shew it, give vs leave to doe as wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oe accordinge to that which wee have shewed you warrant for our of the word.</p>
            <p>And now I pray you examine theſe things carefully, and thinke it not labour loſt to ſearch and weigh ſeriouſly the Scriptures by mee quoted in every point. Know that the Lord will not be ſerved with halves, he will have all or none: I confeſſe you have much good doctrine among you: yea you have the doctrine of Chriſts Preiſthood pure in his Sacrifice and interceſſion, but you have vtterly caſt of his Kingdome, which as the true conſtitution of the viſible Church in the true cauſes eſſentiall thereof, viz: 1. the true matter which are only Saints, 2. the true forme which is the covenant to walke in al Gods wayes. 3. The true eſſential properties which is the powre of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt eſpecially in binding and loſing, without which it is impoſſible for the Church to continue a Holy communion among themſelves: al this you want, and therefore you in the aſſemblies deny Chriſt the King to reigne over you, you have rejected Chriſts Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, for his Teſtament is that which he hath purchaſed with his blood: as you may ſee, 1. Corinth. 14.25. Heb. 10.29. For the Old Teſtament was abolished by the blood of his croſſe, and the new Teſtament ſucceded &amp; in eſtablished in ſtead thereof by his blood: for Chriſt by his Preiſthood obteyned his Kingdome, &amp; now in his Kingdom diſpenceth the vertue of his Preiſhood to his ſubjects: Mr. S. I pray you conſider carefully theſe things, I know they are the vndoubted &amp; moſt cleare &amp; evident truth of Gods word: &amp; that wil I adventure further to prove before any witneſſes, vppon the hazard of my life if I may have audience: do not you now as you have once done in your Letter to Mr. H. take it granted that nether he nor his leaders, as you ſpeak, can anſwere your
<pb facs="tcp:3153:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>arguments, you ſee it is otherwiſe: I pray you doe not oppoſe againſt this truth in your pulpits till you have throughly ſcanned all thinges, &amp; til you have had further paſſages with mee about it: I did thinke that I ought to doe many things againſt this way, but it pleaſed the Lord at the length to reveale his truth vnto me, for the which I bleſſe my God for ever: I know if you once intereſt your ſelfe in oppoſition againſt the cauſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely, it will be very hard for you afterwards to deny your doinges, &amp; to pul downe that which you have built: Therefore be adviſed: raiſe vp your hart to enter into the cauſe, &amp; be not afrayd of it, deny al, even wife &amp; children, &amp; life alſo: els you are not capable of this truth.</p>
            <p>I pray you commend mee to Mr. B. and to your ſelfe moſt kindly: The Lord of his mercy vouchſafe to enlighten you with the evident brightnes of his truth: and the Lord open your hart to entertayne it in love: and the Lord guide your feete into the way of peace: ſo in all kindnes I take leave of you bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you moſt hartely farewell,</p>

            <p>Therfor the Churches of England are not of the Apoſtolique conſtitution, &amp; therfor are framed according to the invention of man.</p>
            <p>The major is proved by the former Scriptures, for Moſes calleth the Iewes an Holy people ceremonially typing that the people of the new Teſtament should be truely holy
<pb facs="tcp:3153:85"/>as Peter doth expound it, and Paull exemplifie it to the Romanes and in all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles.</p>
            <p>The minor is manifeſt: for all ſorts of perſons, Atheiſts, Papiſts, adulterers, theeves, &amp;c. &amp; who not? are compelled to be &amp; are members of the English Churches. Ergo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe from that Church which is not of the Apoſtolique conſtitution, but of mans invention, al the faithful muſt make Seperation, 2, Chron. 13.5.-13. &amp; 30.5-12. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Revel. 14.9.10. &amp; 18.4.5.</p>
            <p>The Churches of England are not of the Apoſtolique conſtitution, but of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
            <p>Therfor the faithful muſt make Seperation from the Churches of England.</p>
            <p>The major is proved thus as Ezechiah perſwadeth the Iſraelites to Seperate from the Church of Ieroboams invention to joyne to the true Church of Iudah which was of Moſes conſtitution, ſo Iohn by viſion is commaunded to pronounce a woe to them that give homage to Antichriſts ordinances, and to perſwade all the faithfull to Seperate from Babylon, which is by interpretation a confuſion: Now all mens inventions are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, ſeing that as Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt are oppoſite, ſo are Chriſtian &amp; Antichriſtians. if ther for the conſtitution of the Churches of England be not of Chriſts, that is of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique primitive frame, it is of man, of Antichriſt, &amp; ſo woe be to them that doe not Seperate from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, your miniſterie is not of the Apoſtolique primitive inſtitution, but framed according to mans invention which is proved thus, Heb. 5.4.5. Levit. 8. compared with Eſay. 66.20.21. Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.3 -6. &amp; Act. 14.23.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The true miniſterie of the Apoſtolique inſtitution was by election, approbation, &amp; ordination of that particular holy people wherto they did adminiſter.</p>
            <p>The miniſtery of the aſſemblies of England is not ſo, but after the invention of man.</p>
            <p>Therfor the miniſterie of the aſſemblies is not the true miniſtere of the Apoſtolique in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitution, but deviſed by man.</p>
            <p>The major is proved by the former ſcriptures, for as that only was the true preiſthood which Moſes by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the L. apointed in the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; therfor that of Ieroboams was falſe, 1. King. 12.31. &amp; 2. Chron. 13.9. So it the new Teſtament that is only the true miniſterie which is of the Apoſtolique inſtitution, viz: by election, ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, approbation, of that faithful &amp; holy people wherto they adminiſter.</p>
            <p>The minor is evident: For the miniſterie of England, viz: the Prelacie, Preiſthood, &amp; Deaconry, like thre vncleane Spirits proceed out of the month of the beaſt, that is are by the Authority of the Romane Empyre eſtablished: Revel 16.15. out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet, that is are by Authority of the Pope of Rome eſtablished: &amp; out of the mouth of the Dragon, that is are by the Authority of Sathan himſelf eſtablished: For ther is not a miniſter in England Elected by that faithful people wher he adminiſtreth, but is choſen by a profane mixt people, if he be choſen, &amp; law doth not allow ſuch election: he is approved &amp; ordeyned by Antichriſt himſelf, comming but of the mouth of the falſe Prophets the Prelates of the Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe, from that miniſterie which is not of the Apoſtolique inſtitution, but of mans invention muſt all the good Chriſtians make Seperation, Deut. 13.3. Math. 7.15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:3153:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>Timoth. 3.5. Revel. 14.9.2. Corinth. 11.13-15. Rever. 2.2.</p>
            <p>The Miniſterie of England is not of the Apoſtolique inſtitution, but of mans inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Therefore all good Chriſtians muſt make Seperation from the Miniſterie of England.</p>
            <p>The Major is proved thus: as in the old Teſtament Moſes commaundeth not to harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to falſe Prophets, Ezechiah endevoreth to draw the people from Ieroboams Preiſt, So in the new Teſtament Chriſt willeth to take heed of falſe Prophets, Paull willeth to turne away from ſuch, &amp; a woe is threatned by Iohn to al that receave the beaſts mark from his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you worship is not of the Apoſtolique primitive inſtitution, but is invented by man &amp; ſo is Antichriſtian: as may be proved thus, Act. 2.4.11.42. &amp; 10.46. &amp; 19.6. Rom. 8.26. 1. Cor. 12.7. &amp; 14.15.26.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The true worship of the Apoſtolique inſtitution proceeded meerly from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit having no outward help of deviſed formes of prayers, exhortations, pſalmes, &amp; Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>The worship of the English aſſemblies proceedeth out of the Servicebook in deviſed formes of prayers, exhortations, &amp; pſalmes, &amp; other Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Therfor the wors his of the English aſſemblies is not the true worship of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>que inſtitution, but is invented by man.</p>
            <p>The major is manifeſt by the places alledged: For vppon the day of Pentecoſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had the holy Ghoſt given them in the shape of fiery &amp; cloven tonges, &amp; thervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they ſpake as the holy Ghoſt gave them vtterance, manifeſting the Spirit to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, &amp; ſo was it with the Gentils afterward when the holy Ghoſt came vppon them, &amp; ſince that tyme all the churches of the Apoſtolique inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worshipped afther the ſame manner, for al Churches worshipped after one manner, 1. Cor. 16.1. &amp; 14.36.37. &amp; 11.2 16. wher note that if deviſed formes of prayers, pſalmes, exhortations, were Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Apoſtles would have delivered them to the Churches, &amp; they should have recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved vppon the day of Pentecoſt fiery bookes as wel as fiery tongs.</p>
            <p>The minor is evident &amp; needeth no proof. Ergo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From that worship which is invented by man, &amp; not of the Apoſtolique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution muſtal the good Chriſtians Seperate, Col. 2.20-23. Mat. 15.9. Levit. 10.1.2. com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared with Act. 2.3.</p>
            <p>The worship of the English aſſemblies is invented by man, &amp; not of the Apoſtolique inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Therfor from the worship of the English aſſemblies ought al good Chriſtians to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
            <p>The major is proved thus: For ſeing the worship of the aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies is wil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>worship, vaine-worship, deviſed by man, not kindled with the true living fire which came downe from heaven vppon the primitive Church, but with ſuch a ſtraunge fire as Nadab and Abihu offered withal, therfor it is idolatry &amp; ſo to be Seperated from.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, the Government of the aſſemblies is Antichriſtian by the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="1">1. The Government of the primitive Apoſtolique inſtitution was by a Colledge of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, or presbytery.</p>
            <p>The Government of the English aſſemblies is by an Antichriſtian prelate &amp; his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
            <p>Therfor the Government of the English aſſemblies is not the primitive Apoſtolique Government.</p>
            <p>The major is evident thus: For the Apoſtles inſtituted Elders by the election of the Saints to overſee the Church &amp; feed the Flock of one particular viſible Church only, as is manifeſt among the Ephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The minor is evident: For the Prelates &amp; ther officers are not thoſe Chriſtian Bishops of the Apoſtolique inſtitution, elected by &amp; placed over one particular Church of the Saynt, but are a deviſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Againe: From the Government which is deviſed by man in the Church, &amp; ſo is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, &amp; which is not of the Apoſtolique inſtitution muſt al good Chriſtians Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Luk. 19.27. 1. Cor. 7.23. Revel. 14.9.</p>
            <p>The Government of the English aſſemblies is not of the Apoſtolique inſtitution, but is deviſed by man &amp; Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>Therfor, from the Government of the English aſſemblies muſt al good Chriſtians Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
